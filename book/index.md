# The Default Setting

**A guide to the invisible systems that drive people, and how to navigate them for a safer life.**

This book is an examination of the "Default Settings"—the mental maps—that individuals use to navigate the world. It is a compass, not a ladder. It does not argue that one way of life is inherently superior to another. Instead, it reveals the fundamental trade-offs that come with each of the three primary Default Settings.

By understanding this model, you can identify your own position, understand the people around you, and decide if the trade-offs you are making are the ones you truly want to make.
