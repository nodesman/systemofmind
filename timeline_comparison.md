To make the comparison concrete, let's use two parallel examples from the same domain: **Christianity**.

1.  For the **Inherited-Static** system, we'll use **Young Earth Creationism**.
    *   **Core Truth:** The book of Genesis is a literal, historical account of a 6-day creation approximately 6,000 years ago. This is an unshakable axiom.
    *   **Defying Reality:** The overwhelming and internally consistent evidence from geology, physics, and biology for a multi-billion-year-old Earth and the evolution of species.

2.  For the **Inherited-Dynamic** system, we'll use **Progressive/Metaphorical Theology**.
    *   **Core Truth:** The Bible is the divinely inspired word of God, containing the ultimate truth about humanity's relationship with the divine. This is an unshakable axiom.
    *   **Defying Reality:** The same evidence for an ancient Earth and evolution.

Here is a timeline showing how each system behaves when faced with this direct contradiction:

| Time / Stage          | Inherited-Static Reaction (The "Fundamentalist")                                                                                                                            | Inherited-Dynamic Reaction (The "Reformer"/"Lawyer")                                                                                                                                                           | 
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Initial Anomaly**  | **Denial & Dismissal:** The first dinosaur fossil is a trick from the devil, a test of faith, or the bones of a creature that died in Noah's Flood. The evidence is an isolated fluke and is ignored. | **Curiosity & Categorization:** The fossil is an interesting puzzle. It doesn't fit the literal story, but it doesn't shake the core faith. It's filed away as something to be understood later. |
| **2. Mounting Pressure** | **Fortification & Conspiracy:** As evidence from geology and biology becomes a consensus, the system builds defensive walls. It creates its own museums, its own scientists, its own schools. It attacks the *motives* of mainstream scientists ("They are pushing a secular agenda"). | **Re-interpretation & Scholarship:** Theologians and scholars begin the work of "interpretation." They ask, "What if the 'days' of Genesis are not literal 24-hour periods, but metaphorical 'ages'?" They argue the Bible is not a science textbook and its "truth" is not in its literal cosmology. |
| **3. Internal Crisis**  | **Purges & Radicalization:** Younger members, exposed to mainstream education, begin to doubt. The system responds by increasing social pressure, demanding stricter adherence to dogma, and excommunicating or shaming doubters. The cost of questioning becomes immense. | **Adoption & Reframing:** The metaphorical interpretation becomes the dominant, "more enlightened" view in mainstream seminaries and churches. It is presented as a "deeper understanding" of the text. Believing Genesis is literal is now seen as simplistic or unsophisticated. |
| **4. New Status Quo**  | **Isolation:** The system survives as a smaller, more insular, and highly committed subculture. It is completely detached from mainstream scientific reality but offers its members a powerful sense of certainty and belonging. It is brittle and perpetually at war with the outside world. | **Integration:** The system has successfully integrated the new reality *without ever discarding the foundational text*. The Bible is still the sacred word of God, but its "truth" has been cleverly transferred from the literal to the metaphorical. The system remains relevant and can be embraced by a modern, educated person. |

### The Core Difference in Failure Mode

The **Inherited-Static** system fails by **shattering**. When the pressure becomes too great, its only options are to retreat into a smaller, harder shell or to break completely.

The **Inherited-Dynamic** system fails by **"explaining away."** Its genius is its infinite flexibility of interpretation. It can absorb *any* contradictory evidence by simply creating a new, more sophisticated legal or theological argument. Its danger is that it can become so flexible that its core tenets lose all concrete meaning, becoming a set of beautiful but empty abstractions.
