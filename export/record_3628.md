  "content": "India is a extractive entity which is en enterprise which has been taking from me to give to UP and Bihar for its political survival while not giving me much in the way of resources, those pepole do not have much in the way of respect for me while taking resources, while.. i do not like their culture while they actively practice cultural hegemony or attempt to. so the reason for this is to ask myself if i should take pride for being indian - but the source of indianness comes from having been under post 1947 india right? \n\nam i extracting a leading conclusion from you? i am looking to oyou to keep me balanced. \n\ni dont knwo if bharat identyti is that much relevant otday at all. i am not particularly proud of it given that it created the caste system and all of its evils. \n\ndoes that mean i am replacing bharat with india - should i? or should i not? lets for purpose of argument say i am replacing or redefining buarat as the current indian state. okay then ew could say that they are people of the realm. in that sense yes i would fight against outsiders like pakistanis attacking the indian identity. which does happen now. and against westerners and chinese trolls who are harmful to indians. \n\nbut am i proud of indians? the goal it to ask if i can eschew the indian identity as a whole when mostly it is a extractive one\n\n"
