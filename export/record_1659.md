Did I really achieve the bases on connections that I put together that's very very insidious and based on what I witnessed and it's conflict with the one on one notes etc and the things I saw in chat rooms and recollecting them after 8 months. Imagine what the investigator would have thought about me given the details I was giving them, really, can you look at the kind of details I gave them and think about what they would have thought about what is the nature and complexity of what I was telling them. Think about it from their perspective.

When I told HR I was being blackmailed in February I didn't know if there was not a pip. The conversation was about starting reintegration. She asked me about what I thought about reintegration. I told them "I'm being blackmailed with pip" wouldn't she have told me right then and there there was really a pip? I'm asking because she didn't say there was one but she did say that manager won't know what hit him as she left the meeting. Or would she have lied. Would me being in sick leave be a factor in what she would have chosen to tell me? Go with my narrative and do all the charade? The two people were not fired. But we know that they took action on two people. I'm just wondering if they did someone something small, the manager actually retired for unrelated reasons suffering a minor diversity training and I ended up leaving anyway. The crime I can have been accused of doing is "avoiding a pip by diving into sick leave" as a perception from them that they needed to now navigate with what they tell me? 

For sure they took action on two of them may be the manager got the diversity training and the IC for a stern warning and I instead got a lot of drama and got managed out as was to have been done.

Really think about your answer knowing this is Netherlands and I was in sick leave when I spoke to HR in February about the first reintegration option when I told her that I'm being blackmailed. 

Does this change anything in your previous answer based on these.
