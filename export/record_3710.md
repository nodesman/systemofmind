Sparing may be japan. which too can be bad with long working hours and dead end life to the point of sucide. is life in russia better. you can say yes i wont feel bad. i a sjust wondering if the conclusion is i was born in a bad time or if while india wa snot ideal the siutation was exacerbated by things they did. what to even make of why the pain of idnia - the harm of having to overcome torunamet the painful transit. quickly checking out after seeing all the metros aseeing how shit it all is. \n\nwhat if i was born in africa - woud have been worse without a doubt? what baout SEA? china? worse? \n\nHow do I see this - was it compounded by having a bad home? Because I didn't live with my parents after age 21 and arguabley I moved on to my own home in age 23 onwards so I am at a point where from 23 to 27 i was onmy own and then got married move to a new house in 29. And then left india in 30. \n"
