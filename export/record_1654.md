I wonder why I realized the PIP and the tension with the guy was related and interpreted it as bullying? I went on sick leave because I couldnt take it anymore not from realization of things being untenable. When things got out of hand and him reporting ordinary things as problematic that is what set things off a bit. He would mention the PIP together with requests for acqueisence with it. and it was always tied to performance. 

Your statement that arrogance resulting in the taunt is valid and makes perfect sense. 

Once you taunt a report how on earth can that relationship turn around?
