  "content": "\n> You said you \"distanced yourself\" from and \"disliked\" the state of things in India, even before you had a real prospect of leaving. This feeling of alienation is the root of your desire to find a new identity.\n>\n> Thinking back to your time in India (your 20s, after college), which of these two domains was the more powerful and consistent source of your feeling of \"I hate this, I don't belong here\"?\n>\n> **A) The Public Sphere: The \"Chaos and Decay\"**\n> *This is about the daily friction of the physical and civic environment.*\n> *It includes things like:*\n>   *   The \"urban hell\" of traffic, pollution, and noise.\n>   *   The lack of cleanliness and public order.\n>   *   The systemic dysfunction, corruption, and bureaucracy.\n>   *   The feeling of being in a low-trust, high-friction society where every day is a battle.\n>\n> **B) The Private Sphere: The \"Social and Familial Cage\"**\n> *This is about the pressure of the interpersonal and cultural environment.*\n> *It includes things like:*\n>   *   The intrusive \"aunty/uncle\" culture and the constant policing of your personal life (marriage, career choices).\n>   *   The hierarchical family dynamics where your voice was not heard.\n>   *   The social conservatism and the pressure to conform to narrow definitions of success.\n>   *   The underlying currents of casteism, sexism, and other prejudices in everyday conversation.\n\n\nI would not say anyone policed by career choices. or marriage. Just my parents. \nThe urban hell of people being rude in Chennai. Not nice. Being degrading. How my college people were very degrading to me. The way everyone was acting like by being white knights (in brown skin) they were superior to me. I hated how people would not give me change back. And would just swallow it. There would be disrespect for people who are younger. Underlying currents of casteism was definitely one of the issues. the lack of dignity in how you were treated in school. I hate how it looked when I looked at buildings - they were all not very tall. Not well built. How they did the bare minimum and considered it done. It also struck me that there was not culture of aesthetic. barely. I hate how in calcutta they had these awful buildings which had not been painted for decades but they acted like it was the aesthetic of the city. Fuck what? How does one live like that that miserly? You do business there for so long. I went to this vegetable market and there was a bunch of old vegetable garbage in between two shops that no one thought to clean. I hate how even my own parents thought it was excessive that I spent more money to dress well. The manner in which my father lived was very ugly when I went to India and saw it. How can someone live in that much filth and grime? Why is there no cleanliness!! why? South India was better than north India in that too. There was this time when someone ripped me off for 100 rupees a fish for fried fish. They asked me how much did you negotiate the fried fish for when i was ready to pay in the beach like I had to negotiate it every time. So i think he gave me the price he thought he could get away with morally asking for which was high. I would think you would sell something for a fixed price as a shop keeper and be decent about it right? I don't like having to think so much about all this. it seemed like I had to develop a sense of how else i can be screwed over. This AC fixing guy came to our house and i was told to pay him 1500. the guy who actually was going to come asked me how much did they tell me to pay him ad I said 1000 and to that he said the price is 1250. Similar to that - this auto guy who was passing by after dropping someone asked me how much do you usually pay for auto for 1km. dude you are the one who has to give me the fare price. there was a auto stand down the stree where they charged 2 times what this guy who was unassuming about the prevailing price charged. many such stories of being screwed over. i was asssaulted by a off duty police constable for not doing my ATM transaction fast enough. I asked him to mind his own business and he assaulte dme and pushed me out of the ATM. I was assaulted by some guy cutting me off in traffic in chennai. The response to that whole nirbahay incident was to become blindly opposed to men and blindly act like all women are hapless innocent victims and assume guilt on the part of men. \n\nThere is no justice practically. There is no enforcement of either criminal law properly. Sometimes you hear about property grabbing by politicians. I as a middle class person pay both taxes and bribes to have to get things done. I get nothing. Not like what I get in the netherlands llike UWV for when I am sick. You are taxed when buying a vehcile and then bad traffic. And bad roads. Every turn there seems to be parasitisim. there aer part of India which I did not ever have to live in where you may be unsafe in your own home. May be muslim dominated homes, etc. Every time I go to sowcarpet it was irritating. how crowded it was. I hated how prior to 2014 the prevailing attitude of politicians was fuck you i got mine. I hate how gandhi bastard was a poverty fetishist. They were opposed to industrialiation and were socialist with no capital economy to back that socialism with to the point where the state was teh only means of sustenance. I hated how a generation voted for rajiv gandhi in sympathy votes after indira gandhi was killed. \n\ni hated how in many realms of life dignity, respect was not a default but a elite or earned treatment. I hate how people felt it iimportant to rage about that whole jalli kattu issue and that girl who committed suicide after failing NEET for medical which by the way is a burden that everyone nationally faces. But no one felt it important to protest about the deaths of people who died from poor roads. \n\nYou may approach the next line of questioning based on this however you want. May be it was not going to take the path that you originally thought. \n"
