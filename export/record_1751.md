**User:**
Given my personality traits - do you think it is possible for me to come into a relationship that can have the kind of exposure to a narcissist like i was in the workplace in a way that I cannot avoid it? A friendship of this nature would it last? I am asking because I am trying to contextualize in which context to be on the look out fo individuals of this nature and work around them
