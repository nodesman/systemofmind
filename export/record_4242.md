These re disproportinately affect Indians. But it is hard to say it is targeted at India. \n\nI've already stoped watching videos about domestic india politics. \n\ndoes india - modi resisting trumps attempt at getting a FTA that allows him to dump milk and agricultural products into india by threatening 50% tarfif on trade from India reflect on me and should it be seen as a victory for me or for the enterprise of india. which may or may not be beneficial to me as an indian. does it affect my reputation as an individual? does american state's imperial conduct affect how americans are seen? what about chinese? what about biriths? \n\ndoes that rooting make sense? with the concern of me being aware of how the global stage of india is being affected? by modi and indians tate? indian americans who were born tehre are being targeted. there is a resentment of indians in the usa for not being backward whilenot beign white. in fact doing much much better. its not like they became americans. it lookslike the zeitgeist has swung back to them being indians who are american citizens.. going by how vivek ramaswamy is treated. \n"
