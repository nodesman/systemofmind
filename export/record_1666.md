I am going to be honest with you: I left the workplace not after detecting things but after it beacme untenable to even exist becusae it was taking issue with everything i was doing - then the HR person contacted me in September upon receiving the doctors report in August at in september i told them that I was being bullied and told the HR in the lead up to the meeting in the email she sent in order to get in touch with me that the manage ris one of two problems at the workplace. which means i already knew he was part of a problem and this was being done in tandem. i had the meeting and sent them a documentn with questions to answer sent to both of their emails and ccing my personal email. furthermore i had the presence to know that this is doable because this is HR affair and not something they can take issue with for confidentiality reasons (putting myself on cc). i told the doctor the following day and she got me time for until i am better and then the worst symptoms were in december then in february is when i spoke to the lady again and that is when the investigation started. i think i should have waited longer to be honest.  I told the doctor that I am being bullied in august. So in that sense i could not fully articulate it in patterns in one after the other. but i sort of was able to do it in march. i am saying all this because what does it entail that i was not able to properly say what was going on but was able to pinpoint in august that i was being bullied and that in september i was able to tell that the manager and the IC was one of two problems ? It's not that I only realized that these two the source of problems but alll I knew in September and August is they were coordinating actions and were bullyin gin the sense of actively making the workplace hostile for me. beign indiscriminate and discouraging ordinary actions. to the point i was blamed repeatedly for everything. that much i know and i knew they coordinated it and they were making it hard for me. i am sorry to say this but i called a friend and asked me if they did it for my good? to push me into sick leave when iw as already in a really bad state - i noticed that too. i was suffering from let down did they deliberately coordinate a hostile work environment thing to push me into sick leave? and i mean with that specific intent? i thought they were doing it ot make me take sick leave which i was not and they saw that i was struggling but looking back it was a strange line of reasnoing - but it hung in my mind to this moment when i articulated it.  i thought that too. if they were otherwise good people. i even asked my friend if that was the case - but if so he would have just asked you to go on sick leave right? but that guy discouraged scik leave so that thought rang there too. somehow all these arguments are in my mind and they manage to act simultaneously and end up winning almost like a machine learning model which is incredible. so ipieced together non verbally events about what happened. which is incredible. 

which means i slowly built up a picture over november december etc. i was even worried about going on sick leave with a pip coming and me going on sick leave did the HR person who contacted me in august know about it? the doctor and i became very good friends and she told me that she may have told them that in august.
