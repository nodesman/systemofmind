And that those were a sign of wealth. \n\nI could be wrong but to me it looks like everyone is under a pressure to live up to a ideal and those are likely on credit. So everyone would have bought off a house and a car and a trailer and potentially a boat for weekends and those are possible in rural salaries of professionals and not even silicon valley levels or tech? \n"
