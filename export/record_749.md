  "content": "To my knowledge I am not able ot point to one family without a major problem or i dont know enough about them. One of my cousins lost their house, her parents caused her divorce, she is on h1-b living in the usa as a single mom. Her father squandered the money she sent for EMI for theri home and because of hte financial burden differences with her husband led to her being divorced. Another cousin is also single in his late 40s. another cousing got drunk and crashed his car and didnt hold a job, squandered his fathers property ona  bad business, and also.. embezzled money somewhere got fired, bad mouthed his boss and got fired. is a dependent at age 48 with wife and child. no income of his own. another endured crushing debt and ruined their parents money. may be a picture perfect family.. so am i to conclude that everyone has as sad family? becuase this is just among my cousins. another cousins faterh committed suicide and her mother was not exactly morally right so to speak.. seems scary. in all this i see one thing though - most of the people who affected us negatively are poeple from other families who married into our family. except my cousin who got drunk and crahsed a car and got disabled is clealry stupid. \n"
