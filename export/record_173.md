While you collated my thoughts into coherence I did not see adequate addressing of my thought process - what I gain value from is when I feel that I feel understood by you in what I am trying to convey as well as that you've put the ideas in a balanced perspective not anchored by my wording of premises. The balanced and realistic perspective of my positions helps solidify my perspective and helps close that chapter and help me heal or help me move towards a more balanced perespective. I get therapeutic value in that sense. Your last responses didn't have enough of that
