So this idiot, father of mine, piece of shit, he, I don't want to go into the morality and I don't need a, I don't need, I really don't want advice from you about or judgment about you about me hitting him, but when I went last, I beat him up badly, you know, but not enough to my satisfaction. I did not beat him up enough to my satisfaction, but I beat him up. Apparently he told, I mean, my mother went down, I mean, my mother came and stopped me from hitting him and then we went, I went to my room, apparently after that, he went and spoke to my mother and my mother, he told, he told her, what do you think of the situation? I don't feel safe. I mean, he doesn't feel safe and he says if this happens again, he'll call the police apparently. And what is, what I am not able to tolerate and it's very, very, it's even more, even more making me angry is the fact that he, he has beaten up my mother many times while living in that house in Chennai in the 90s in the Reserve Bank quarters, he's beaten up my brother many times, hit, hit and slapped, did many things, just once he hit me badly when I was sleeping to force me to come to not, to not ask questions so that he can force me to come to the doctor, the dispensary where he needed to get medicine for my brother and he needed to show some child with him to get it. So he, he beat me up for while sleeping because he needed to get his work done. He didn't have a decency to say, explain what and why. It wasn't even necessary, he could have just said that, but he beat me up. He has beaten me up for when someone, apparently someone told him that some other child was hitting me and for that, he came home and beat me from morning to afternoon, repeatedly. He beat me up for someone else getting chain snatched and my mother blamed, mother hit, mother expressing her anxiety and anger at him and he chose to beat me, calling me because I walked too forward apparently. He beat me for, when a neighbor brought me home after I got my hand burned, instead of comforting me when I was, when I was terrified and I was in pain, he chose to beat the child who had just gotten injured. It just makes me so angry that this guy is like this. What gives him the right to take issue with me beating him up when he did all that?
