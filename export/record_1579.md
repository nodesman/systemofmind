See, as a career strategy, I always held the opinion that you should not become a company loyalist, or become blindly trusting, or be very, very clear if you are being rewarded for your efforts. For example, this company tried to dangle a bonus, but this guy behaved disrespectfully and lied. So that was cheating. And, yeah, given the loss I've experienced. I'm trying to ask you if continuing. See, I always felt bad that I wasn't being a company loyalist, trying to do the best, being aware of what was going on. I'm trying to hold the credits, make sure I'm seen. Instead of having this certain, some people have this ideal that if you do good work, the rewards will follow. I thought that was a wrong way to go about. I should be very specific. If I'm doing work, I should ask to be recognized for it. I'm trying to ask you if this is a unhealthy or not ideal way of approaching work in the private sector
