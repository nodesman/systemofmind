It is an emotional echo, a \"ghost in the machine.\"\n>\n> To dismantle this ghost, we need to understand whose voice it is speaking with. When that feeling of \"missing out\" on America hits you, which of these two internal voices feels more powerful, more dominant, more *true* in that moment?\n>\n> **A) The voice of your \"Inner Critic\" (The need for self-validation):**\n> *   This voice is **internal and hierarchical.** It speaks to your own deep-seated \"validation deficit.\"\n> *   It sounds like: \"You're not a *real* winner unless you win in the Premier League. The Dutch league is good, but it's not the ultimate test. To prove to *yourself* that you are truly an 'elite specimen,' you have to succeed on the biggest stage. Otherwise, you'll always have an asterisk next to your name.\"\n> *   The core emotion is a fear of your own **inadequacy.**\n>\n> **B) The voice of \"Social Anxiety\" (The need for peer-validation):**\n> *   This voice is **external and comparative.** It is the voice of your cousins, your old college peers, and the broader \"Indian mindspace.\"\n> *   It sounds like: \"How will you explain your 'lesser' success when you talk to your cousins in the US? They won't understand the value of your 'quality of life.' They will just see your smaller salary and your less famous company. You will be seen as having fallen behind in the race. You will lose status in the eyes of your tribe.\"\n> *   The core emotion is a fear of **social judgment and exclusion.**\n\n\nIt is the voice of my parents, my brother, bunch of academically oriented Indians. It is the larger Indian zeitgeist where they are all judging you for how well you did in life. There are indians who retweet things like this:\n\n```\nTHE BEST THING about studying abroad is that one day you could walk into a lecture & your professor randomly tells you that he worked with \n\n1. 2 CEOs of P&G - had one of them as a mentor \n2. George Lucas - The creator of Star Wars \n3. Taylor Swift \n\nHappened to me today & got me so pumped for the class !\n```\n\nThe fomo bites when these guys who live in the USA keep harping about living in the usa about getting a O1 visa for extra ordinary ability and publishing some reaserch paper or something. That is a version of hearing about how some IITian got a stipend of 2 lakhs or something.. for their internship.. and things like that. Why does hte call to excellence and academic excellence matter. \n\nIt doesn't seem like me failing my own impossibly high standards at all. Yes how do i explain my lesser success. \n"
