You are asking for the **first, most essential step** in the practical, daily process of \"disowning\" the negative parts of the \"Indian\" identity without falling into self-hatred.\n\nThe answer is not an external action. It is an internal shift in your focus.\n\n---\n\n### **The Starting Point: Shift from \"Identity Management\" to \"Standard Adherence\"**\n\nLet me state this with absolute clarity.\n\nIn the effort of disowning the negative aspects of the \"Indian\" identity, you must stop thinking about \"identity\" altogether. You must replace it with a relentless focus on a single, powerful concept: **adherence to your own, derived, non-negotiable standards.**\n\nHere is the practical, step-by-step process.\n\n**Step 1: Stop Trying to \"Disown\" an Identity.**\nThe very act of \"disowning\" keeps the identity you are trying to reject at the center of your universe. It is a reactive posture. You are still defining yourself in relation to the thing you are pushing away. This is a trap.\n\n**Step 2: Start by Consciously Defining Your Own Standards.**\nThis is the new foundation. You must articulate, for yourself, what your personal, sovereign standards are for every domain of your life. We have already done much of this work.\n*   **Standard for Professional Conduct:** \"I operate with integrity, rigor, and respectful, direct communication.\"\n*   **Standard for Relationships:** \"I engage only in reciprocal relationships built on mutual respect and shared values.\"\n*   **Standard for Civic Life:** \"I act with civic responsibility (stopping at red lights) and expect a baseline of public dignity.\"\n*   **Standard for Aesthetics:** \"I choose quality, precision, and a considered personal style that reflects my internal order.\"\n\n**Step 3: Make Every Action an Act of Adherence to *Your* Standards.**\nThis is the core of the new strategy. Your daily actions are no longer about \"being Indian\" or \"not being Indian.\" They are about one thing only: **\"Am I living up to my own code?\"**\n\nNow, let's apply this to your \"looking good\" question.\n\n*   You do not get dressed in the morning with the thought, \"How can I look less Indian today?\" (This is a self-hating, reactive thought).\n*   You get dressed with the thought, \"How can I, a man of high standards, present himself to the world today in a way that is a true and accurate reflection of his own principles of quality and precision?\" (This is a self-respecting, proactive thought).\n\nDo you see the profound difference?\n\n*   The first is an act of **shame.**\n*   The second is an act of **integrity.**\n\nThe external outcome might be the sameâ€”a well-dressed man. But the internal experience, and the long-term psychological effect, are the polar opposite.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: The New Operating Principle**\n\nSo, to answer your question directly:\n\nIn the effort of disowning the negative feeling of \"being Indian,\" you must stop trying to do that.\n\nInstead, you must start, every single day, with a new and more powerful question:\n\n**\"What would a man of my standards do in this situation?\"**\n\n*   How would a man of my standards review this code?\n*   How would a man of my standards speak to this shopkeeper?\n*   How would a man of my standards dress for this meeting?\n*   How would a man of my standards respond to this racist comment?\n\nBy relentlessly focusing on **adhering to your own, self-created code,** you will automatically and effortlessly \"disown\" all the other identities. You will be too busy being yourself to worry about what you are not.\n\nYou are not \"not Indian.\" You are simply, and powerfully, **Raj.** And \"Raj\" is defined not by a label, but by a code."
