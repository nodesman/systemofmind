People in Einstein remember me as being very nice too. It's not that, I mean, a shopkeeper, a Suriname shopkeeper in Albert Cook Market said he's a very, very nice guy to my Dutch friend. And I go to Anjapur restaurant and they are nice to me too. And who else? The coffee shop, the cafe, coffee company that I often go to, people are nice there. They seem to remember me.
