Should I accept that manager guy being fired as reason for me being happy? I feel like I should sue him. But suing him and holding him accountable is a lot of effort - he is hiding in alicante in spain and i am a dutch citizen. I have to serve him for which I may have to personally go and ensure that he lives in that address that i found out via google maps when he posted photos out of his window and it showed very particular set of buildings visible from google maps satellite view. will i be able to compel him to appear before a dutch court? That will be so much effort to write letter stating this is my case against you and that I want this much damages. 

Should that be directed at the company instead? Was €50,000 too less that I accepted? This is far more than an average MTA costs on average here. But you know. Given what I’ve been through.

Or is it that I am definitely am going to always feel like I have not gotten enough justice without complete and total defeat and sueing of both of them the IC and the manager? Should I instead let the feelings pass and pragmatically move on with life 

Should I just accept that this whole affair costed me €4000 something euros in legal fees? I am not sure but my lawyer asking for the investigation report in writing may have precipitated his firing or may be not because the HR person told that he won’t know what hit him referencing my manager. 

One other thing that somewhat bothers me is - this guy caused grievous psychological injury to me. I neither held the company nor him responsible. Should I approach the firing and the settlement as the restitution?
