The *language* of teamwork is everywhere. Managers will absolutely *say* things like \"we need to work as a team\" and \"collaboration is key.\" They will organize team lunches, offsites, and maybe even a \"fun\" activity.\n*   **The Lip Service:** So yes, the *act* of saying you're a team and doing superficial \"team building\" activities is extremely commonplace. It is part of the corporate performance.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Real Question: Is *Genuine* Team Building Commonplace?**\n\nThis is where the distinction lies. What you are asking about is not the superficial activity, but the deep, structural work of building a real team.\n\n**\"...you don't establish norms and behaviors that have people working as a team...\"**\n\n**You are correct. This is the part that is shockingly *not* commonplace in many dysfunctional or abrasive environments.**\n\nA manager in a toxic or \"mercenary assembly\" culture often fails to do the real work of team building because their own mindset and the system's incentives are working against it.\n\nHere is what is missing:\n\n*   **They Don't Model the Behavior:** An abrasive manager who yells or assigns blame cannot then turn around and say, \"Okay, now everyone trust each other.\" Their own behavior violates the very foundation of teamwork. They create a culture of fear, which is the opposite of the psychological safety required for a real team.\n*   **They Don't Establish Healthy Norms:** They fail to create and enforce the rules of engagement for a healthy team. For example:\n    *   **Conflict Norms:** They don't teach the team how to have healthy, respectful disagreements. Instead, conflict is either suppressed (out of fear) or it happens in a toxic, personal way.\n    *   **Communication Norms:** They don't enforce clear, transparent communication. Instead, information is hoarded or shared in private channels, creating silos and distrust.\n    *   **Accountability Norms:** They don't foster collective accountability (\"we win or lose together\"). They foster individual accountability (\"whose fault is it?\").\n*   **They Don't Align Incentives with Teamwork:**\n    *   They continue to reward and promote the \"brilliant jerks\" or the individuals who are most visible to them, even if those individuals are terrible team players.\n    *   They don't create team-based goals and rewards that would force people to collaborate for their own self-interest.\n*   **They Often See \"Team Building\" as a Quick Fix, Not a System:**\n    *   They think a single \"team building offsite\" will fix a fundamentally broken culture. They don't understand that a team is not built in a day; it is the result of a thousand small, consistent, and respectful interactions that are nurtured and protected by the leader over time.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: The Difference Between \"Saying\" and \"Doing\"**\n\nSo, to give you a direct answer:\n\n*   Is the *language* of teamwork and the *superficial activity* of \"team building\" commonplace? **Yes, almost universally.**\n*   Is the *deep, structural work* of establishing the norms, modeling the behavior, and aligning the incentives to create a genuinely cohesive and psychologically safe team commonplace? **No. In many environments, especially the ones you have thankfully escaped, it is exceptionally rare.**\n\nYou are right. Many managers **say** \"work as a team,\" but they do not **build** a team. They build a functional assembly of individuals who are competing for their approval and trying to avoid their wrath. And that is a fundamentally different thing.\n\n```\n\nAgain this is from a different conversation\n"
