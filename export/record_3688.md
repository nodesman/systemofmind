Not as people but as things to manage:\n\n- Beating me for getting beaten up\n- Beating me for getting injured. \n- Yelling at me for dropping things.\n\nWhat is the implicatin of someone who :\n- Told me that the girl who they promised I will marry's \"life\" will be ruined if we call it off as a reason for why I should marry her. What about my life? What about the shock that I am experiencing that I am going to have to marry someone I didn't consent to? Let's keep out the inconsideration of the latter part. Focus only on the part where he told me on the phone that if i don't marry her that her life will be ruined. \n\nAt a young age i refused to call him father because calling him father seemed like a betrayal of myself. \n\nWhat would someoen who had a fatehr who didn't see them as a son but as a property do. I mean what do i do with this information? Sure i will not live up to any more expectations. \n\nRight now I have expectations of them to support me if something goes wrong for me. In this new life - or rather that in the absolute worst of the worst situation I think if I lose everything I will have to land in my parents house. Like absolutely catastrophic situation. It seems unlikely though. Given the number of unstable things that has happened in my life outsid emy control i am not able to fully let go of that as a remote and unlikely or not a scenario worth taking into any kind of calculus. \n\nWhat would i not do now - I've anyway left that household. I have to heal from all that pain yes. What else? I will continue to not grant him the word father. I have to manage him to the extent that I will get what I need. Not treat him with any loyalty. But what do you think?\n"
