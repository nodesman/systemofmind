What do you feel when you know that this is all the maximum amount of money you'll make in life or this is the maximum you'll achieve in life? How do you even quantify achieve, you know me saying I'll never be an astronaut even that free at this point. We know for a fact I live in the Netherlands. I don't, I cannot become an astronaut. It's impossible even saying that because I have to be either in a poor country that has a space program or I have to be in a country that yeah, I mean I have to be in the military. See even saying that I'm not able to accept whether I feel sad even saying that I cannot become a doctor. I guess I can say that I don't feel bad about that. It's fine. I'll never be a lawyer. Should I now start writing off everything i am not going to be?\n"
