I am very confused by his expectation that after spitting in my face, beating me and humiliating me in front of others, he would expect me to treat him like a father who was loved, for whom I would have gratitude and admiration for or something.

There were a few instances where reactive harm was very pronounced, very very pronounced. This was in early childhood and his mentality was discovered or rather the things that I saw was really bad. For example, beating me up for getting bullied by someone in the playground. Not even a little bit, a lot. Imagine beating a child from morning to afternoon because of that. Imagine beating a child because your wife is blaming you for not walking next to her because you are trying to catch up with your son while someone else on the street got chain snatched. So you are blaming your son and you call your son and beat him up.
