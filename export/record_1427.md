I also of my own believe there is no pride in living a life in India. You grew up just to live in that shit pile among those people. Is this a new piece of information? I don't, I have a very low opinion of Indian society, I think. Spending a lifetime, spending my life in that society seems like a waste. It's another truth.\n"
