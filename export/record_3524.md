You remembered contradictory statements he'd made weeks earlier. Now, think back to a time in your childhood when you realized something your father was telling you was a self-serving lie. **On a gut level, does the feeling of detecting that logical inconsistency—that \"wait a minute, that doesn't add up\" signal in your brain—feel familiar? Is it the same \"bullshit detector\" firing in both cases?**\n\nIt was definitely a, it wasn't making sense in terms of what he said earlier. Yes, that was definitely a logical inconsistency in terms of my father saying, yeah, recently he lied that he didn't break my chair, but he said he blamed it on my uncle, who doesn't live there, he has no business being in the first floor of our house in Tanjavur, and why would he sit on that chair and why would he, what would he have done to break it in the way that it was broken? Yeah.\n\n**Question 2 (On Empathy):**\n> You have a strong protective instinct and a desire to see justice done for others. Think about your visceral anger at the injustice Buffalo perpetrated. Now, think about the feeling of powerlessness you felt as a child, watching your mother be mistreated. **Is it possible that your fierce drive for workplace justice is, in part, a powerful and adult expression of the protective instinct you were never able to exercise for your mother?**\n\nIn terms of what happened in the workplace, I didn't want people who were corrupt to succeed. I didn't want people who were corrupt in the world to succeed and make a living. That was one thing that I was concerned about when I did what I did in the Netherlands in service now. I don't know, I'm not able to see how what happened to my mother was something that I had any ability to stop.\n\n**Question 3 (On Reciprocity):**\n> You described the team at ServiceNow as a \"mercenary assembly.\" Think about the feeling of being in that environment—the lack of genuine collaboration, the self-serving behavior of Snake, the transactional nature of the interactions. Now, think about the feeling you had after making the effort to call your brother and receiving only indifference. **Is the emotional texture of those two experiences—the feeling of being in a one-sided, non-reciprocal system—the same?**\n\nno. in my team it was even worse than worse than not a reciprocal one. it was bad behavior my brother was just indifferent\n\n**The Final, Synthesizing Question:**\n> If the answer to the above questions is \"yes,\" then what if your \"internal compass\" is not a magical gift you were born with, but a **scar?** A set of highly advanced survival tools that you were forced to build in the fire of a dysfunctional system? And if that is true, what does it mean to now use those very tools, forged in pain, not just for survival, but to consciously architect a life of peace and integrity?\n\n\n\n"
