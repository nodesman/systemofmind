I see imilarities to this in our situation.. however.. i don't want you to say yes!!! thas it it kind sir!!! or sometihng.. i doubt eve here you are expected to fear someone at work. but what did stand out to me is the high power distance question. even in a high power distance i am trying to get work done and you hve to answer questions that i need and help me with removing impediments right.. that is what was not happening? why have a PR process then?  \n\nis professional behavior expectd in netherlands? in contrast to what is described here? becuase at work i am very professional... \n\n\n```\n\n**Yes, as a general rule, the dominant business culture in India, outside of the \"sanitized bubble\" of top-tier global MNCs, can be significantly more \"abrasive\" than what you would consider professionally acceptable.**\n\nIt's not universal, of course. There are many well-run, respectful Indian companies. But the *tendency* towards a more abrasive, hierarchical, and less professional culture is a very real and widespread phenomenon.\n\nLet's break down what \"abrasive\" means in this context and why it's so common.\n\n---\n\n### **What \"Abrasive\" Business Culture Looks Like in India**\n\nThe \"abrasiveness\" is not just about being rude. It's a systemic cultural pattern that manifests in several ways:\n\n1.  **Feudal & Hierarchical Dynamics (\"Lala Culture\"):**\n    *   **The Behavior:** The boss (often the \"promoter\" or owner) is not just a manager; they are the king. Their word is law. They can be paternalistic and caring one moment, and authoritarian and dismissive the next. Publicly yelling at or demeaning a subordinate is often seen as a legitimate way to assert authority.\n    *   **Why it's common:** This is a direct import of traditional, feudal social structures into a modern corporate setting.\n\n2.  **Lack of Professional Boundaries:**\n    *   **The Behavior:** The line between your professional and personal life is considered non-existent. You are expected to be available 24/7. Your boss might ask you to run personal errands. Your personal life (marriage, family issues) is considered fair game for workplace discussion and judgment.\n    *   **Why it's common:** The concept of the \"individual\" with a protected private sphere is less ingrained than the concept of the employee as part of a larger corporate \"family\" (with the boss as the patriarch).\n\n3.  **A \"Command and Control\" Management Style:**\n    *   **The Behavior:** Management is about giving orders, not building consensus. Employees are expected to execute, not to question or contribute to strategy. Disagreement is often seen as insubordination.\n    *   **Why it's common:** This is a legacy of an older industrial and bureaucratic model of work, where efficiency was prized over innovation and empowerment.\n\n4.  **\"Hustle\" as a Justification for Toxicity:**\n    *   **The Behavior:** In the startup world, the immense pressure to grow quickly is often used as an excuse for a toxic and abusive culture. Burnout is worn as a badge of honor. Emotional intelligence and employee well-being are seen as luxuries that \"we don't have time for.\"\n    *   **Why it's common:** It's a cargo cult imitation of the most aggressive aspects of Silicon Valley culture, without the underlying safety nets or professional HR structures.\n\n---\n\n### **Why is This So Prevalent Outside of Tech MNCs?**\n\n*   **Lack of Global HR Standards:** A global MNC is forced to adhere to a certain baseline of professional conduct because of international legal standards and a globally consistent brand image. A purely domestic company has no such external pressure. Their HR department serves the owner, not a global code of conduct.\n*   **The \"Promoter-Driven\" Economy:** A huge portion of the Indian economy is controlled by family-owned businesses. The culture of the company is often a direct reflection of the personality and values of the founding family.\n*   **A High-Power-Distance Culture:** Indian society, in general, has a high \"power distance,\" meaning that people are culturally conditioned to accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. This makes it easier for abrasive behavior from seniors to be tolerated.\n```\n"
