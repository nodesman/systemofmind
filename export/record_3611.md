The Tamil state didn't \"suddenly disappear.\" Rather, it underwent a long, complex period of fragmentation, foreign domination, and gradual absorption, which created the conditions for the British to eventually take over.\n\nThe story is one of a slow decline from the peak of the Chola empire, followed by a series of invasions and the rise of new, non-Tamil powers who came to dominate the region.\n\nHere is the timeline of what happened to Tamil sovereignty leading up to 1700.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: The Decline of the Imperial Cholas (c. 1200–1300)**\n\nThe \"sudden disappearance\" narrative is a bit of an illusion caused by the immense shadow of the Chola empire. By the 13th century, the Cholas, who had dominated South India and the Indian Ocean for centuries, were in terminal decline.\n\n*   **Internal Decay:** The empire became overstretched and faced internal rebellions.\n*   **Rise of the Pandyas:** The **Pandyas of Madurai**, the ancient rivals of the Cholas, re-asserted their power and became the dominant Tamil kingdom in the late 13th century. This was not the end of Tamil sovereignty, but a shift in power from one Tamil dynasty to another.\n\n**Sovereign in 1300:** Primarily the **Pandyan Kingdom,** a powerful Tamil empire.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: The Catastrophic Invasion from the North (c. 1311)**\n\nThis was the first major blow to long-standing Tamil sovereignty from an outside power.\n\n*   **Malik Kafur's Invasion:** As we discussed, the armies of the **Delhi Sultanate** under Alauddin Khalji, led by his general Malik Kafur, swept through the south. They sacked the Pandyan capital of Madurai in 1311.\n*   **The Aftermath:** This invasion shattered the Pandyan empire and plunged the Tamil country into a period of chaos and political fragmentation. For a few decades, a short-lived, independent **Madurai Sultanate** was even established.\n\n**Sovereign in 1350:** A fragmented landscape with the **Madurai Sultanate** controlling the southern core, and various local Tamil chieftains controlling other areas. Tamil sovereignty was effectively broken.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: The Rise of the Vijayanagara Empire (c. 1370–1646)**\n\nThis is the most crucial period for understanding the transition. The power that \"saved\" the Tamil country from the Sultanate was not a resurgent Tamil dynasty, but a new, powerful, **Telugu- and Kannada-speaking empire** based in modern-day Karnataka.\n\n*   **The Conquest:** The Vijayanagara Empire systematically conquered the entire south, including all of the Tamil lands, by the late 14th century.\n*   **The System of Rule (The Nayak System):** The Vijayanagara emperors did not rule the Tamil country directly. They administered it through military governors called **Nayaks** (or *Nayakkas*). These Nayaks were often from Telugu or Kannada warrior lineages.\n*   **The Legacy:** For nearly 300 years, the Tamil country was a prosperous and stable province *within* the larger Vijayanagara Empire. While Tamil culture flourished, **political sovereignty was no longer in Tamil hands.** The ultimate authority was the emperor in Hampi (Vijayanagara).\n\n**Sovereign in 1550:** The **Vijayanagara Emperor,** ruling through powerful Telugu-speaking Nayak governors in Madurai, Thanjavur, and Gingee.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: The Fragmentation of Vijayanagara and the Rise of the Nayak Kingdoms (c. 1600–1700)**\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire itself was shattered after the Battle of Talikota in 1565. This led to a new political reality in the Tamil country.\n\n*   **Independence of the Nayaks:** The powerful Nayak governors, who had once been vassals of the Vijayanagara emperor, now became effectively independent rulers. The most important of these were the **Nayak kingdoms of Madurai, Thanjavur, and Gingee.**\n*   **The Maratha Interruption:** To add another layer of complexity, the Marathas, expanding from the north, conquered the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom in 1674 and established their own **Maratha dynasty in Thanjavur.**\n\n**Sovereign in 1700:** The Tamil country was **not** under a single sovereign. It was a fragmented mosaic of competing states:\n*   The **Madurai Nayak Kingdom** (ruled by a Telugu dynasty).\n*   The **Thanjavur Maratha Kingdom** (ruled by a Marathi dynasty).\n*   The remnants of the **Gingee Nayak Kingdom**, which was being absorbed by the expanding Mughal Empire.\n*   The **Nawab of the Carnatic** (based in Arcot), who was the official representative of the **Mughal Emperor** and was beginning to assert his authority over the region.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: The Stage is Set for the British**\n\nSo, to answer your question: What happened before British colonialism?\n\nThe Tamil state did not suddenly disappear. After the peak of the Cholas, it entered a long period where its sovereignty was first fragmented, then lost to the Delhi Sultanate, and then systematically replaced by a long and stable period of **non-Tamil, Telugu-speaking rule under the Vijayanagara Empire and its successor Nayak kingdoms.**\n\nBy 1700, the Tamil country was a political patchwork, a battleground for competing Telugu, Marathi, and Mughal-backed powers. **There was no unified \"Tamil state\" left to conquer.**\n\nThis fractured political landscape was the perfect environment for the British (and the French) to exploit. They did not conquer a single, powerful Tamil empire. They played one local power against another—the Nawab of the Carnatic against the Marathas of Thanjavur, and so on—until they had absorbed them all.\n\nThe \"reappearance\" in the Indian state was the result of the Indian independence movement creating a new, federal republic where the old linguistic and cultural identities, like the Tamil identity, could re-assert themselves as powerful political units (states) within the larger national framework."
