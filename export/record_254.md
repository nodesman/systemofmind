So here's the mentality that I am not understanding. Okay, let's say I coerce and I beat him up black and blue, and force destroy his body or something, some completely, and make him apologize or something. He'll say, I'll apologize, I apologize. But I remember getting some apology like that, and it turned out to be fake. Combine this with the idea that, the fact that, he has in the past... He has in the past... You see, there are some behaviors I am considering if this is fact. Like for example, one time apparently he... My mother asked him why he didn't do something, why he didn't tell her about some revision, and apparently his response was, if I say it, you'll lambast me. So he decided to do it without saying it, and he's now going to some other city. Basically, he'll tell you what is necessary. He will not face the consequences or have a difficult discussion or anything. He'll say what is necessary to get what he wants without consideration for what is necessary. Similarly, he also tried to coerce or not coerce. He used to do that thing on the phone where, yes, yes, okay, okay. And then he does that thing in the voice where... I mean, while talking on the phone, he'll say something, and I'll say, yes, okay, okay. And I will be formulating a response and saying no, but it will almost seem like he's trying to make you say yes. And then he'll hang up the phone. I'm trying to say, even if I beat him up, he'll say what is necessary to stop it. When he tried to force me to marry that girl, he tried to do something. He didn't care about what happened, whether I liked or not. He went and told yes because they were being insistent towards him. And apparently because he liked it. His justification, see, after almost 13 years, I found out that he said yes because they told him... That family which wanted to marry their daughter to me, they told him that they didn't want to come again another time for a betrothal. And therefore, why don't you do it right away? Say yes and take the plate, you know, the ritual plate right away. And apparently to that, he said yes. Despite the fact that they may have come to, I mean, they may have come to the house in order to see the house. That's what they said. They came to the house to see the house. And he flew from Mumbai to Tanjore to see, to entertain them. And then apparently they asked this and he said yes. And then he, on the phone, he was forcing me or rather he was manipulating me to accept it.
