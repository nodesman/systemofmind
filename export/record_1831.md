How does this happen in a compoany like servicenow which is konwn to have significant but not 100% top of the line engineering talent. to tme this seems ameteurish. For someone who claims to have had a lot of experience as a manager this doesn't seem adequate furthermore, how can one keep a job when things go bad like this? how is 'if things go bad jus tleave' for reasons beyond my control fair? how do i put this down in my life? the company was mismanaged? and had systemic problems? give me a balanced story of how do i put this down in life for what happened?"
