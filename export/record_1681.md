5. No I didn't know that is what I was going through until after the sick leave and the first HR conversation and then 4 or 5th doctor's appointment. I could feel constant tension I shit you not this one time in April I remember thinking "if something goes wrong don't blame youreslf" i don't know why this guy who is subconscious thought that and told that to me.

4. I have interacted with her informally in a lunch years prior. That was was the first time that PM joined the team after the earlier PM went on sick leave. Limited to no interaction. Know she is tennured. She came to the office and has been helpful when asked for help. Didn't seem to avoid me or anythign. I don't know what to make of it but she posed on the team chat that you should feel comfortable to post in public chat. (which is a gap between the manager and her - she seems more chill about interactions being matter of fact but he took issue with it - can you think of why?) After the manager was fired and I had to endure a painful set of negotiations I ran into her in the train station in the platform. She saw me and avoided me. I don't know what to make of it. This is ouside of work context. With my manager - I only spoke to him on 1-1 i greet him if i meet him for sure. But there are limited to no opportunities to talk to him outside of 1-1 and team lunches. he doesn'te ven attend stand ups. may be once a week. 

3. They were saying use your authentic voice and how to avoid team toxicity etc. and other people were way more i would say raw in chats like this IC in quesion. (but just him). 

I think the anxiety and pain that I felt made me react as well - compounded by the let down effect it all felt intense may be. I think it may have had effect on me. 

2. I thought about may be reaching out to her in private but she @'d me in public and it felt time bound so I felt like I had to say something. friday was two days away

I spoke to the manager who told me to get in tocuh with him if it happens again. 

1. Monthly in 1-1. Just the "you hear feedback whether or not you acted on it" one stood out but in retrospect. I didn't even knwo what he was talking about. May be I should have spent time to clarify it? May eb that is the mistake?

I am seeing the pattern that went wrong - @'s. This one time i escalted this individuals\ behavor in the public team chat. That may have been a huge gaffe on my part. 

So my interactions with people may have been bad becuase of let down effect. 

Look I just think at all times I am trying to do my best. What is the point of this yelling and what is this goign to achieve? What am I here if not to help?
