What does their government give them? Compared to Indian government? Reliable power and road? \n\nIf one were to ask that question of if I should identify as an Indian what does it mean? Practically speaking\n\nIn light of how I look and my skin color \"looking\" Indian is not my choice. So where does this even fall in that ? \n\nDo you follow where I am going with theser series of questions? Are you able to determine what I am trying to do? \n\nCan you help me by answer or helping me answering these questions\n"
