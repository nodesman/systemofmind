Why does it suggest they were already thinking of taking action on him because she said she had a file on him. Which is odd because it's my first time properly getting down to brass tacks with HR about him. This was said emphatically when I mentioned " I have reason to think I wasn't the only one impacted by him" (question what likelihood is it that this emphatic statement is also playing along? But they did a whole thing like investigating etc) keep in mind they didn't ever formally tell me they forced him out. What file on this manager can they already have?  I didn't tell them about the macho comment until the February HR conversation
