He would give me money and ask me to buy tickets in a train station. And then he would watch me. He would find a way to say I failed somehow. I was holding the money in my left hand apparently and that was me being unsafe. So it was like he was watching how I will fail and then was using that to criticize me. It wasn't an effort in teaching. It was an effort to find out how I can be criticized that day. Do you understand? He'll give me money to buy ticket. I was holding the money in my left hand down and I was asking for a ticket at the ticket counter. Apparently, I was holding the money in the view of other people.
