I just want to ask, this is in the Netherlands, not in the USA or India. Okay, I want you to think about if HR would have... The first time I reported to HR in August, after which that guy freaked out. After which he... After which he... Tried to report my LinkedIn post as... Business. It looks like the HR person who was then there may have had a discussion with the manager, I don't know. But then she herself went on sick leave. And then she came back only the following June, almost 11 months later. In the intervening period, another HR person came and she... Another HR person came and she... Took over and actually asked me questions from scratch. Asked me questions from scratch. She told me that... They are trying to get in touch with my manager, but on that day that I had my discussion with that HR, to make sure you understand the chronology, I spoke to the second HR almost seven months, eight months after the incident. She said she's trying to get in touch with my manager and I saw that very same day on February 27 when I spoke to her. February 27, 2024. The incident happened in June, July 2023. In February 27, 2024, that guy was on sick leave, but he was facilitating a meeting and my friend had witnessed that. It looked like he was avoiding the HR. I don't know why. But for sure, he had sick leave on his calendar, but was definitely facilitating a meeting. Okay, that's for sure. Okay. I'm trying to understand if... HR knew about what happened, but we're trying to downplay it. Why I'm saying this is it took them three months to do the... to do the investigation, but the investigation was, to be honest, not that simple. I... Would they have tried to not fire him and instead manage me and only have thought to fire him after I found out that I got in touch with the manager, got in touch with the lawyer and needed, wanted the investigation report in writing?
