In contrast, you described the Indian Army's culture as one of \"service before self\" and \"leading from the front.\" When you think about your \"contributions,\" does the feeling resonate more with the **pride of a high-performer who has won** (i.e., \"I have valuable skills to offer\"), or does it resonate more with the **duty of a leader who must care for his people** (i.e., \"I have a responsibility to help those I left behind\")?\n\nIt is definitely not pride of a high performer. More of duty to forge a better future as the meaning of my existence. If in this world. The peoples of the world are not united and we are not working together yet - we still act like nations and races - which is not what I hoped the world was like. I used to even think yathum oore yavarum keleer. But Do people of other nations operate with that thinking? There is racism in China, Anglophone societies, Korea even in Arab countries. I have this vague sense that a future in which Indians have firmly a powerful feature in human future, in the world future is impotent - and that is done by building a better India to live in. \n\n(Ask me why, I would like to explore this)\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n> You've described a desire to create a \"Chola Empire\" legacy and a fear of your lineage just \"disappearing.\" At the same time, you've decided to let your caste die with you. Does your concern about \"contributions\" to Tamil Nadu feel more like a desire to **ensure the survival and prestige of your personal bloodline** within the Tamil story, or is it a more abstract desire to **contribute to the flourishing of the Tamil *civilization* as a whole,** regardless of your own family's role in it?\n\nGood question. In my earlier answer I said Indian citivilization and yet there is a conflict with what I may have said earlier about Tamil culture. Good catch. Regardless.. contributions are more a desire to build a future and continuing Tamil/Indian civilisation. \n\n**Question 3:**\n\n> You have successfully escaped what you've described as multiple flawed and harmful systems (familial, corporate, national). When you think about \"contributing back\" to India, does the feeling come from a place of **guilt for having escaped** (a \"survivor's guilt\" that you need to alleviate by helping), or does it come from a place of **strength and compassion** (a genuine desire to use your hard-won security to help others navigate the same traps you did)?\n\n\nIt comes from strength and compassion. Or rather knowing better. Idealism I guess. I saw contributions in this context as not something from where I did but the opportunity to contribute from within India as a resident while enduring the fortress and such. Does that change your earlier answer about my departure and the value of those contributions to India? \n\n\n**Question 4:**\n\n> You've mentioned creating a \"Chola Empire\" website as a tangible form of contribution. Let's do a thought experiment. Imagine two futures:\n>   A) You create a world-class, globally acclaimed website on Chola history. It wins awards and is used by scholars and students everywhere. It brings great prestige to Tamil culture.\n>   B) You quietly and anonymously mentor five young, brilliant engineers from Thanjavur over two decades, helping them navigate their careers, escape bad situations, and build secure lives for their families.\n> Which of these two outcomes gives you a deeper, more visceral sense of having made a \"real\" contribution?\n\nA) becuase it feels like I have made a wider impact. \n\n**Question 5:**\n\n> You've described your \"Ekalavya\" journey of self-reliance. You had to fight for everything you have. When you think about \"contributing,\" are you more drawn to the idea of **\"fixing the broken system\"** (e.g., funding a project to reform urban infrastructure in Thanjavur) or to the idea of **\"arming other Ekalavyas\"** (e.g., giving talented individuals the tools and resources to escape the broken system, just as you did)?\n\n\nI saw contributing as two things I guess: a) playing a role in the economy as a high value contributor who got a lot done and created successful careers b) contributing to evangelism of urban planning changes. \n\n\nWe may have more questions to ask but does this give a picture if so what, and do we want to go into more questions because this was very interesting and clarified some things for me. And was strangely therapeutic. \n"
