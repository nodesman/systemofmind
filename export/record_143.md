I can tell you that he grew up in a household where parenting was more Laissez-faire

He did mention very early in life that the only job of father is to pay school fees. This was when i was a small child less than 10 may be 8. 


What was the loss to me from his inability to give me money?


Do you agree with the premise of satisfaction - why? think if anything implies a satisfaction being derived from my verbal statements combined with your konwledge of pathologies and the pattersn that this  or if your premise is flimxy would you change it? 

he without being asked got me a computer at age 14, then another one in college and a laptop when i was about to graduate - it was  good laptop too. this was after being debarred from college so he went to malaysia and bought it. there may have been a budget from the rbi but i don’t know if that discounts what he did. 

without being asked he gave me a USB dongle for internet when i joined tcs at the training centre. but keep in mind that this is after the college internet and after him knowing i was so insisted on needing money for internet that i would ask every now and then. 

he also committed this act:
- he committed to an arranged marriage of me to someone who i explicitly declined. he earlier said he will not finalise someone without telling me. when we went to see her we saw her and he came home and asked me if I like her to which I said no. He did that thing where he acted as if my no was me kidding or being coy or something but i said no. But i didn’t think much of it. Then i went to interview for a new job in Hyderabad and suddenly he called and said he committed to me marrying that girl. Then they did that thing where he would say “okay? okay” and then end the call without letting me speak. he was in the euphoria of the moment of having “Accomplished” that commitment to them. Apparently he flew from mumbai to tricky then thanjavur to entertain that family in the house. this entertaining them at our house he did after i declined that girl outright after going to their house and seeing her. apparently that family was interested in seeing my family’s house and he flew in to entertain them and at that point that girls father said it will be another trip to come back so why don’t you accept it and they were a bit pushy about it so he just said yes and started gaslighting me into accepting it - preventing the discussion. he said “you will love her”. he enlisted my brother and told him a one sided story and he played a role in trying to coerce me to accept it. in the end i cancelled the marriage by telling the girl myself. 

i lived every waking moment with unfair things like this hanging on me every waking moment. 

i was debarred from college for hacking the college computers. i changed the passwords called the chancellor a motherfucker. then had to pay a fine if $4000 and repeat a year in college that was a financial burden on him. if there is something i did “to” him - this happened - i don’t know how to reconcile this. help me reconcile this given that i am his son. what is a healthy way for me to give myself just enough healthy and ethical closure and not unfair punishment for myself. 

My question is: do you think i was in active “danger” or risk of something bad happening every single moment? was this father’s behaviour indulgent? hurt was coming my way for unfair and unnecessary things? meaning would i be justified in saying i exited in a 

give me a balanced perspective 
when i underwent divorce his handling of the divorce was botched - he filed a restitution of conjugal rights claim and waited for me to find her address wafter she rand out of my house in the netherlands without leaving an address. this is just incompetence. leave that out. i guess in his limited way he would listen to me on the phone but talking to him for extended periods ruined my mental health. but he contributed to my criminal defence along with my brother when that incident happened. 

he never called after the divorce to ask how i am doing despite me being completely shattered.  

D.1 The ultimate goal is of my effort is I want to feel that you know everything there is relevant to know about my life with this father - so that your summation of events are based on a complete and comprehensive consideration. i want to see evidence that you do in your wording and reasoning such ashow you cite examples. i would like you to word the reasoning out to help me get confidence that you derived carefully the reasoning. use any known formal derivation methods for this if you must. i am not asking for literal mathematics but even just in wording examples that you understand everything that happened and based on that formed a balanced summary of him as a person and how i can make sense of him. i am trying to “afrekenen” my father and bring him to a close and make sense of him. to that effort:
- do you agree that this whole D.1 is premised on the fact that if he had dome something extraordinary for me that would change the account? Setting aside the realistic plausibility of it. 
- realistically is such an extraordinary impact on me in contrast to all the other things he did even possible?
- based on this do you have advice to me about seeking completeness for this reason? or is it justified to do so? i need a balanced answer

This is complicated by unhealthy indian parental schema some of which you rightfully already pointed to. 

when the forced marriage was being done i reached out to my aunts and unclesa and tow of them “advised” me to marry that girl or my reputation will be ruined. this was not said to me as something they will do but something that will happen by way of how i will be spoke about if people inquire about what i did (but in retrospect they were wrong about this). there was a shocking narrative there- that the choice of who i will marry can be so shoddily “conceded” in the face of this. 10 years later this same uncle acted like it was always my free choice to cancel that prospective marriage matter of factly and marry someone else. when in that moment he was saying the only way to cancel this is by destroying my reputation as s drunkared or something. 

It does beg the question how does one put this in peace and accept what happened to me. What would give me peace?

Can you derive, intuit by analyzing the trend of questions, the natuer of them, the intent behind them, collect them and form a projected line of stakes in teh ground beliefs to build. not beliefs in the sense of asking you to tell me what ot believe but beliefs in teh sense of what (belief - in the fomr of sets of questions or concept) does not seem to be clear and that is why i am still continuing to suffer and that which i need to build up and clarify. 

i currently feel anger that someone like that did something ike that and he was able to. a part of me wonders if i let msyelf down by letting someone like that do it to me. 

i need you to not take my words to arrive at conclusions but work with me to arrive at them. be skeptical but not critical. help me reach confidence with your reasoning ability.
