Okay another time I was in the airport and I was going to Thailand and this Indian guy said me I thought maybe you're Thai. I don't know how he made that jump but that really did happen. And then twice when i was talking on that pattaya beach road in 2019 i was tol dby this clealry lower class north indian guy "you havae a tummy, make sure you drink [some brand of milk] keep it in fridge, drink once a day" almost 3 years later another north indian guy on the same road in the same country said 'you are balding a bit, make sure you use [some brand of oil]" wtf? clearly something triggered the last two responses. Again clearly north indian slightly lower class based on how he was dressed
