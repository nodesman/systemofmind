And? Is there sufficient solidarity with me as a Tamil from other Indians? Am i making the wrong leap to say that just because Karanataka, maharashtra had anti-tamil sentiments in the past and that UP and Bihar are trying to carry out cultural hegemony against my culture through vedic hinduism then other states dont have solidarity with me as an indian? it took 3-4 days as of 2015 to report on the chennai floods? is that just news media bias? \n"
