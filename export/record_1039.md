We only have information about what the Indian system did or did not do for me. Maybe I developed capabilities beyond it and there's also my I particularly come from a urban locality which means my education is slightly better than someone in a rural locality I think. I was raised in Hyderabad which was slightly better than Chennai for sure. I'm just trying to ask you what is exactly the improvement in over the Indian upbringing in you know I'm not avoiding exactly go to some American school or something but it was okay it's not bad it's a bit religious right but religion was just a sideshow of otherwise okay CBC school. I'm trying to ask you what could people here resisted and I guess that kind of a gradation exists here also either you went to some school in host where there are a lot of migration people so to speak migration background versus there are a lot of people who who were in who went to gymnasium. I'll tell you one other thing I know this lawyer she went to some you know I'm still being gymnasium she made mistakes in the she works as a lawyer in Amsterdam but there were mistakes in the were in her in her work there were I wouldn't say she made the most powerful point.
