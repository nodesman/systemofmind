We know that a passport can be a fragile tool for this. We also know that your physical appearance is a fixed variable.\n>\n> So, let's get to the core. In a future encounter with a potentially prejudiced person (a Korean, an Arab, a white American), from where do you want your feeling of **unshakeable, non-negotiable dignity** to come?\n>\n> **A) From a sense of **Superior Accomplishment**: \"You may see a brown man, but I am a Staff Engineer who has survived a journey you cannot imagine. My achievements make me your equal or superior. You *must* respect my competence.\"\n>\n> **B) From a sense of **Sovereign Indifference**: \"Your opinion of me, based on my skin color or your cultural hierarchy, is a reflection of *your* ignorance, not *my* worth. It is irrelevant to me. My dignity is intrinsic and does not require your validation.\"\n\nWhich of these two mindsets—**the warrior who proves his worth through achievement**, or the **king who knows his worth is inherent**—feels like the more powerful, peaceful, and sustainable foundation for your new identity?\n\n\nI would prefer B. I do not want to not use B and instead use A as compensation to the premise of racism. Like I am black but I am denzel washington is a game that is best not played. But it also begs the question. Which is more healthy? And which is more pragmatic? If I change my career does that mean my whole sefl esteem for my standing in this world is falling apart? Seems like I am cornering myself in life. I will soon be enterprising and that will involve somehow losing the glamour of the amazing career tag and the prestige of software engineer so that I may get to high reward situations. In principle this is a more long term and healthy strategy. But I also do not want to ooperate from a sense of naive idealism either \n"
