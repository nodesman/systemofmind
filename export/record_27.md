I was in a antique store in Pattaya and that lady who was there who asked me and I asked about a particular cup and she asked me if you're Indian but you live in some other country. I don't know if I should feel offended by that but I love Thai people so I will always forgive them but on the surface it's a bit offensive or no maybe I don't know. I asked how did she know and she said because sometimes indians react a bit strongly but she didn't use these words but the non-verbal and verbal things adds up to the react a bit strongly part.
