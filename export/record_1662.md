Did I really then review the entire conversation and tell me, did I really construct a complex narrative based on things I saw? See, we all work remotely. So based on what I said, based on what I saw while seated in my house, most of the time what happened happened in my house in the work laptop. I even once had to take my laptop to the middle of a park in order to not carry that emotion from that one-on-one with him back into my house. Well, more negative things are being done. Did I really combine things I saw in meetings, in chat rooms, in specific timelines and put together a story based on what he said earlier, the entire image in one shot and tell them this? And I managed to get him removed based on this because this didn't happen in an office where other people saw it. 


When I was discussing reintegrating they gave me an MTA which I subsequently rejected and then we discussed reintegration which the HR was resistant to do. I tired to forced them to reintegrate me. But they told me something that indicated to me that the situation is untenable. The following meeting she remarked having earlier having been resistant to reintegrate that she was hoping to make me a manager which is not something you would say about someone you want to get rid of or she was being manipulative I don't know. What do you think?
