So I wasn't paying attention to deteriorating relationship with my manager? Because I only noticed him asking me to attend the meeting because I am being paid for it instance. I had not reason to think he was this upset. Then the public chat message seemed evasive too. So that meeting is the first instance i knew he was angry. and the previous 1-1 was 1 month ago. Although I decliend the 1-1 2 week sprior becuase of being sick
