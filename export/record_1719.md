This manager seems to have spent time in a) having a 1-1 as usual and then 3 more 1-1 in week apart. Giving 1 week in between in order to see if any complaints from this IC came up that he can discourage me from doing. for someone who had been receiving these complaints for almost a year but had only one 1-1 a month in the trailing period and no other conversations to resolve it - were those 3 half an hour 1-1 other than the regularly scheduled 1-1 seem like additional effort in a significant way? What I am asking is does it seem like what he did was coming from an inability to handle the issue and he did this because he thought this is the right way (his chosen way to do it in the sense of he was doing it to get rid of the problem or was he properly addressing it in his better wisdom) What does it seem like it happened here? Does having taken those 3 half an hour to even 5 minute conversations had he done it earlier he could have avoided this. But if he was lazy then why do this? I know that they were under a lot of pressure to deliver on the project that the IC had worked on the months prior.
