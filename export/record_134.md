It looks like my brother also endured a lot of abuse. He was unable to love you. The three of us lived in that household, my mother, me and her brother, around a horrible human being who was so indiscriminate and inconsiderate. I am rushing to undo the effects of it as if it didn't happen, but how can I do that? It happened. I want to intuit and work through so much of the things that may have been unconsciously internalized about what that guy decided he wanted to do. I mean, in general, before you had enough agency, someone was extremely abusive. I want to point out, see, I don't remember any situation where there was any fatherly affection from him. No, I do not. I stopped calling him Appa because of the sheer amount of humiliation that was done to me and injury.
