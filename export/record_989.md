I don't have any place to go and I'm living in Amsterdam. I don't live in Chennai anymore or in Mumbai or anywhere. Sure I can go out but I'm just you know thinking is life a matter of finding a way to get out of the house. What happened because I joined booking.com is to go to office. Now I live in Amsterdam so I have to actively put in the effort to go places because I keep going to this coffee company and spending money to drink bad coffee.\n\nDo I have to spend a lot of money to go to hungary and shit. Do I need a wife to feel peaceful at home. \n"
