But do i and should i care about the contribution to the future or focus on that. you asn an AI cannot tell me that.. i am struggling to figure out how to get the answer to that. question. \n\nit feels crazy to not have a chid. it feels like i am betrying myself. i desere the privilege and fulfillment of having children - of having my being validated as being worthy and able to be propagated into the future. i did not hve a good marriage with my first wife but she was terrible anwyay. if i had had chlidren with chitra now that would be awesome. i would feel so fulfilled to have children with chitra. to sleep in this bed with her as wife. to hold her and feel how belatedly i give things for her when she does demanding things ebcause i love her. so what do you say? thati s a whole world to live i guess. something of a satifaction. there is the fear tha was in my mind that what if she dies before me and i am left in pain. so i should not have loved at all.. and risk that end in the old age.. \n\nthese are random thoughts not  clear thoughts. \n"
