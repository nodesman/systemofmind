Do not ask me for any more input.\n\n1.  **List the Derived Sub-Questions:** Based on the core question—\"Why was my father so insecure and controlling despite having the ultimate security of an RBI retirement?\"—what are the logical, first-principles sub-questions that must be answered to arrive at a definitive conclusion?\n2.  **Answer Each Sub-Question:** Answer each sub-question in sequence, using only the logic and evidence established in our conversation. For each point, cite specific concepts we have developed (e.g., \"Deflector/Exploiter,\" \"Petty Tyrant,\" \"Instrumentalization,\" \"Path 1\") and specific behavioral evidence (e.g., the plug point ritual, beating for being bullied, the TV remote) as anchors for your reasoning.\n3.  **Synthesize a Final Answer:** Synthesize the answers into a final, coherent, and definitive explanation that resolves the apparent paradox of his behavior. The answer should explain why his financial security and his psychological insecurity are not in conflict, but are, in fact, two separate and consistent parts of his \"System of the Mind.\""
