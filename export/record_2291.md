Saying so and so things were done. I mean to ask this in general - what is that thing - where they seem to have an agency and agenda that doesn’t take your needs and wants into account (such as hitting me when I am asleep and forcing me to come with him to get pills from doctor) booking flight tickets and then telling me while I am employed becuase he needed to get things done. I don’t mean to ask about my father but that interface - having to be around them seems irritating -someone who is so self-serving. I am not sure if self-serving is the word - he is annoyed and irritated by anything getting in the way of what he wants (taken away from TV by mother because of being asked to teach me studies, being criticised by my mother for not walking beside her while someone else got chain snatched - that was inconvenient for him - he may have actually been trying to catch up with me a child - but if you hit them then how is that fair - almost seems subhuman to be honest but this is still an example and not bringing my father into the equation - but that tendency - I say tendency becuase this person seems to be like a worm acting on impulses and not from reasoned thought)"
