Is that something that's just a bias? Should I just let it go? I'm just trying to make sure my children have a trajectory that is not mediocre. They do something good with life, achieve something. Or should I say they should just become be happy, become part of the gene pool in the Netherlands and disappear into the void? Or should I, should I, what is the right thing to do? Should I be an Indian parent who will push towards a certain outcome? Because sometimes children need direction. They don't know what they want. Sometimes they do. Should I work, focus on helping them discover it? Should I help them become the best version of themselves? If it's a girl, why should I not focus on letting her get married and have children at age 22, 23? Should I not have wishes for greateer and greater success from my wards? build on top of me and make generational power? chola empire? "
