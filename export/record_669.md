  "content": "I grew up with a brother who often spoke poorly of me and made fun of me, even when I tried to say something positive about myself or my future goals (like wanting a good marriage or building a home). His mocking was discouraging and shaped the way I see myself. Because I respected him, his words had power over me, and I still feel like part of my mind is under that influence.\n\nI want you to ask me piercing, thoughtful questions that help me uncover:\n\t•\tWhy his words had (and still have) such an impact on me.\n\t•\tWhat part of me is still carrying that influence.\n\t•\tWhy I struggle to give myself credit and recognize my own worth.\n\t•\tHow I might begin separating my own self-image from his negative judgments.\n\nPlease use your understanding, inferences, and heuristics to ask me as many deep, clarifying questions as possible. Your goal is to help me spot the roots of this problem and guide me toward reclaiming my self-respect and giving myself credit where it’s due.\n\n⸻\n\n"
