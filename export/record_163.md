no no. sorry if this is draining you. we can stop here if you want. i am struggling to 1) value myself adn carry myself in high self regard given that my own father's offered narrative of me was of some personal minion and dervied from his own negative rock bottom self esteem. what he offered seems to take legitimacy over mine "resaoned" and adjusted one - i am working on changing that by discrediting him as a whole and marking him down as a life handicap so that i can lend legitimacy to my own reasoned slef esteem
