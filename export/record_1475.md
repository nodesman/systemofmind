This identification must have been serving a positive function. It was a \"borrowed armor\" that made you feel strong.\n>\n> Let's analyze the specific properties of that armor. When you were younger and \"identifying with being more like in a foreign country,\" which of these three specific, positive values of the \"Anglophone\" ideal was the most powerful and attractive to you?\n>\n> **A) The Value of Individual Freedom & Sovereignty:**\n> *   Was it the idea of being a free individual, able to make your own choices about your career, your partner, and your life, without the interference of family and society? Was it about breaking free from the \"collective cage\"?\n>\n> **B) The Value of Meritocratic Excellence & Impact:**\n> *   Was it the idea of a pure meritocracy, where the \"best of the breed\" rise to the top based on skill and achievement? Was it the allure of being at the \"center of the action\" (Silicon Valley), working on \"world-class\" problems and having a massive, visible impact?\n>\n> **C) The Value of Modernity, Order, & Progress:**\n> *   Was it a more aesthetic and environmental attraction? The idea of living in a clean, orderly, and well-functioning society? Was it the appeal of a \"modern\" lifestyle, free from the chaos, dust, and \"bare minimum\" culture you despised in India?\n\n\n\nSo yes on one side I was borrowing that armor in order to cope with living in a coutnry whose faults I overwhelmingly was acutely aware of. I actually assumed that I woul dhave the freedom to choose partner, career and life without interference of family and society given the generation I was in even while living in India. So that was not the allure of anglophone soceities. \n\nThe thing I most identified with anglophone society is the aesthetic and environmental attraction -clean orderly well functioning society. free from cahos and dust. Some amount of excellence and honor in everyday conduct. In a sesne the best of the breed do rise to the top in India too. But in a brutal sense. it was also the allure of silicon valley and the ability to potentially have a massive visible impact for sure. Culturally people being nicer and kinder to each other. \n"
