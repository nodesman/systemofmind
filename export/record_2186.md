Kai: Your AI Coding Partner Overview: Kai is a command-line tool designed to act as an AI-powered coding assistant, deeply integrated with your local development environment. It leverages powerful language models (primarily Google’s Gemini Pro and Flash) to understand your codebase context, answer questions, generate code, and even automatically apply discussed changes directly to your project files after review. Core Functionality: Conversational Interaction: Engage in conversations with the AI about your code. Kai manages conversation history, allowing you to pick up where you left off. Context-Awareness: Kai intelligently reads your project files (respecting .gitignore rules) to provide relevant context to the AI, leading to more accurate and helpful responses. Scoped Context Control: Define specific “scopes” (sets of files using glob patterns) in a .kai/scopes.yaml file to precisely control which parts of your project are sent to the AI. This helps manage context size, cost, and relevance. AI-Powered Scope Suggestions: Not sure how to define scopes? Kai can analyze your project structure and suggest potential scopes using AI. Sublime Text Integration: Kai uses the subl command-line tool to open conversations in Sublime Text. You can review history and type your next prompt directly in the familiar editor environment. Closing the editor sends the prompt to Kai. Code Generation & Modification: Ask Kai to write new code, modify existing functions, refactor, add documentation, etc., based on the conversation and provided context. Consolidation Workflow: This is a key feature. After a conversation where code changes were discussed, you can trigger the “Consolidate Changes” mode. Kai will: 1. Check for a clean Git working directory. 2. Ask the AI to analyze the entire conversation and determine the final state of all affected files. 3. Generate the necessary code changes (creations, modifications, deletions). 4. Present these changes as diffs in an interactive terminal UI (using blessed) for your review and approval. 5. Apply the approved changes directly to your project files. Flexible Configuration: Configure API keys, model preferences (Gemini Pro vs. Flash), directories, and more via a config.yaml file. How it Works (CLI/Sublime Flow): 1. Run kai in your terminal within your project directory. 2. Select a mode: “Start/Continue Conversation”, “Consolidate Changes…”, “Manage Scopes”, etc. 3. If starting/continuing, select or create a conversation name and choose an AI model. 4. Kai opens Sublime Text (subl -w) with the conversation history displayed below a separator line. 5. Type your query/prompt above the separator line, save the file, and close Sublime Text. 6. Kai reads your prompt, sends it along with relevant context (based on scopes or defaults) to the selected AI model. 7. The AI’s response is added to the conversation history. 8. Repeat steps 4-7 to continue the conversation. 9. Optionally, use the “Consolidate Changes…” mode (or the /consolidate command within Sublime) to review and apply the discussed changes to your actual project files. Origin Story: This project was born out of a desire for a more integrated and contextually-aware AI coding assistant. I started developing Kai during my third month [mention context if applicable, e.g., “learning”, “at my new role”] shortly after an interview experience at Uber. That experience highlighted the need for tools that could deeply understand a local codebase and assist with complex, multi-file changes, leading to the creation of Kai with its focus on context management and the unique consolidation workflow."
