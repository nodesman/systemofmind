  "content": "I spent time in Tanjore recovering from the pain from the workplace harassment as well as Finally reaching safe harbor so to speak and I got my naturalization What pervert this is and then hitting a fork in the road. Keep in mind I set out in a path towards the Netherlands After the US visa was rejected with the hope of building a family and a future here. That was the plan Just figure it out. So I Am now figuring it out. I the burden I placed was on the Netherlands being a very advanced society Even advanced societies have failures and problems How to what extent is what happened to me changed by the fact that My parents are learning by conflict or rather first they Did arrange marriage force arranged marriage and then learned how badly I was impacted and then my mother is behaving very abrasively even now but I fought back and she learned and they are they have some sort of change now, but The house in a strange way. Their household was difficult to live in but they did it Duty, my mother was dependent on my father and they didn't have a very good relationship But they carried themselves through life somehow at the heart. I think I have to owe them the duty See I lived in the Reserve Bank quarters in India and somehow that was a bit of a privileged upbringing Somewhat but my house for my parents home was not peaceful and that impacted me I was never heard, you know, we already went through this in order to get what I needed I needed to shout or break things or get angry in order to be heard It's not possible to be heard easily. I learned how little I was heard by after I left in I left the household Left my parents house, but my mother She was very beautiful. She cooks a lot You know She took care of me even at age 38 when the complex trauma and she took me to a doctor All of that happened. It was good. So it was not all for nothing It's very complicated, but they learned they supported me through the divorce\n\nI know my brother is useless and harmful, interacting with him has no point because he will anyway find some reason to undermine you, there is no productive conversation that can be had, he's some idiot who seeks to undermine you at every chance that he gets, he seems to get a kick out of it, so that's true, and I think I should let him go. Next is his tendency, what I'm trying to say is, what I can blame on, yeah, the early drama, is it the fault of my parents, to what extent, while I was their child, my mother gave me, I don't know if I'm giving too much credit or not, please do tell me, and why you think I'm giving too much credit or if I'm paying the right amount of credit, my mother took care of me and we had, we did, we have Diwali and all that because of her, we have all the festivities like Indian festivities because of her, so that's good. So, it is my parents fault for not hearing me out, they did things like make decisions from me without asking me, without respecting me, like that forced arranged marriage was something they did and I had to go and clean it up and prevent it from happening, I endured the shock of what happened, every single time, they would go look for some girl, they would not do a thing like, do you want to go see this girl, no, they'll say I'm coming and then I'll have to go see the girl, you know, I'll make the promise out to someone else that I'm coming and then I'll have to go see them and then say I'm not interested. I think this is a problem created by my brother, my father, anyway, but he did, you know, carry us through life and what else, should I be grateful to him for getting a job in the Reserve Bank of India and creating the circumstances for me, he didn't do it for me, is that fair to say, because I lived in the Reserve Bank of India, should I also blame him for not being even richer then, do you understand this question, does it make sense, is it fair to say this, why were you not richer, why were you not, why did you not immigrate, why did you not do that, why did you keep me in the Reserve Bank of India, was that the best you could do, should I blame him for that, if that is also true, then why should I, that's my reasoning for why I cannot blame or credit him for being, giving me a Reserve Bank of India, does it make sense or is it unfair, does that mean I should say that I am lucky to have been raised in the Reserve Bank of India, I don't owe you thanks for that, it is a privileged upbringing, but on top of it, you did not give me a safe and decent other home where it was pleasant, it was traumatising.\n\nWhich brings me to the other point, I eventually, my career improved enough for me to leave my parents' home and then I lived on my own and then I eventually left the country because I felt there was no point in continuing to live in that country or any place where the, I mean it was always self-evident that it was time to leave the country. It is not the truth, it was always the truth, it was very self-evident that if you can leave the country you should not live your entire life in India. It was so obvious to me at the time.\n\nSo what really is the source of my pain? What all can be attributed to the pain?\n"
