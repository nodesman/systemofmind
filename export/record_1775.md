Given that was the impact of them disproportionate? am i giving them too much empathy? to emphasize the equivalent fault you must commit as a software engineer and not as a manager - what must one do - an equivalent thing, come up with an example scenario for me for which the outcome is same and also the root causes are the same but the failings were committed as a software engineer instead of a engineering manager
