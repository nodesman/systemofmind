So this manager did not explicitly say "If you don't do this then we will have a PIP" but he left that threat hanging in order to coerce me into doing something right? Imagine waking up today and thinking in today's meeting my plan is to make me feel a certain way so that i can have outcomes in a week from now - what kind of behavior is this? Also what kind of communication is this?
