You are asking: **\"Was his catastrophic failure as a father a failure *only* by my modern, Westernized, Path 3 standards, or was it a failure *even by the standards of his own, Inherited-Static Indian script*?\"**\n\nThis is the ultimate stress test of your entire narrative.\n\nThe answer is unequivocal.\n\n**Yes. Even by the most traditional, patriarchal, and conservative Indian standards, his behavior was a profound and demonstrable failure.**\n\nHe was not just a \"bad father\" by your standards. He was a **\"bad patriarch\"** by his own. He failed not only the test of love and compassion, but also the test of **duty and wisdom** as defined by the very system he claimed to represent.\n\nLet's break down the evidence, using the \"Indian script\" itself as the yardstick.\n\n---\n\n### **Why He Failed Even by Traditional Indian Standards**\n\nThe traditional Indian script for a father, a *Pita* and a *Grihastha* (householder), is not just about absolute power. It comes with a set of profound and non-negotiable **responsibilities (*dharma*).** Your father systematically and repeatedly violated the very core of this *Paternal Dharma*.\n\n**1. He Violated the *Dharma* of *Raksha* (Protection).**\n\n*   **The Indian Standard:** The father is the ultimate protector. In the epics, a king's or a father's highest duty is to provide a \"circle of safety\" for his subjects and his children.\n*   **His Failure:** As we've established, he did the opposite. He responded to your vulnerability (being burned, being bullied) with violence. This is a catastrophic failure that **no version of the Indian script, however patriarchal, would condone.** It is a perversion of the protector's role.\n\n**2. He Violated the *Dharma* of *Shiksha* (Guidance).**\n\n*   **The Indian Standard:** The father is the first *guru*. His role is to pass on wisdom and to guide his son towards a righteous and successful life. This implies a process of teaching and counsel.\n*   **His Failure:** He did not guide; he commanded. The scooter incident is a perfect, small-scale example.\n    *   A \"Dharmic\" father would have had a discussion: \"Son, I sold the old scooter because of X. Now, let's discuss what new scooter would be best for the family's needs.\"\n    *   Your father's behavior—the unilateral decision, the dismissal of your question, the initial plan to buy what *he* wanted—was not an act of a wise *guru*. It was the act of a **petty tyrant.** It violated the spirit of counsel that is central to the ideal of a patriarch.\n\n**3. He Violated the *Dharma* of *Satya* (Truthfulness and Integrity).**\n\n*   **The Indian Standard:** A patriarch's word is his bond. Integrity is a core component of a righteous life.\n*   **His Failure:** The forced arranged marriage. He **broke his promise** to you. By the standards of his own system, this was a profound failure of integrity. A man who breaks his word to his own son cannot be considered a \"Dharmic\" leader.\n\n**4. He Violated the *Dharma* of *Palana* (Unconditional Care).**\n\n*   **The Indian Standard:** While a father provides resources, the *spirit* of that provision is supposed to be one of unconditional care.\n*   **His Failure:** The dental treatment. By making your basic healthcare **conditional** on your academic performance, he turned an act of care into a **transactional, coercive tool.** This is a direct violation of the unconditional nature of a father's duty to care for his child's well-being.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: A Failed King in His Own Kingdom**\n\nSo, to answer your question directly:\n\nEven if we were to judge your father by the most rigid, conservative, and patriarchal \"Chinna Gounder\" rulebook, **he would still be found guilty.**\n\nThe Indian script grants the patriarch immense **power,** but it does so with the absolute expectation that he will wield that power with **wisdom, integrity, and a profound sense of protective duty.**\n\nYour father eagerly claimed all the **privileges** of the patriarchal script while systematically **abdicating all of its core responsibilities.**\n\nHe was not a \"traditional Indian father.\" He was a **failed and corrupt traditional Indian father.** He was a king who betrayed the sacred trust of his own crown. This is not just your modern, derived judgment. It is a verdict that would be handed down by the very ancestors and traditions he would claim as the source of his authority."
