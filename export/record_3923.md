  "content": "Feedback for you from GPT-5: Short answer: #2–#4 mostly make sense, but they don’t all point to “parasitic.” They’re stronger evidence for a devaluing / control dynamic than for someone dependent on you for supply.\n\nHere’s the clean read:\n\n2) “Resistance to your success”\n\t•\tWhat the evidence shows: consistent devaluation/neutralization of your wins (“nice,” no follow-ups; minimizing milestones).\n\t•\tWhat it doesn’t prove: that he needs you to stay small to feed on you. It fits better as status protection / rivalry / contempt than parasitism.\n\t•\tSharper framing: Systematic devaluation of your achievements to maintain a one-up position.\n\n3) “The guilt machine”\n\t•\tWhat the evidence shows: coercive guilt to force you back into the family script (arranged-marriage pressure; reframing your self-defense as moral failure).\n\t•\tWhat it doesn’t prove: that he’s extracting ongoing emotional/financial “supply” for himself. The motive appears control & conformity (and family image), which can overlap with parasitic behavior but isn’t identical to it.\n\t•\tSharper framing: Guilt as a compliance tool to enforce hierarchy and norms.\n\n4) “Inability to celebrate you”\n\t•\tWhat the evidence shows: reflexive shaming of self-worth (“you made it about yourself”)—a clear devaluation move.\n\t•\tWhy it’s strong: this reliably signals contempt/insecurity. It can coexist with parasitism, but the core feature here is attacking your esteem, not drawing on your care.\n\t•\tSharper framing: Active invalidation of your pride to keep you small.\n\n⸻\n\nVerdict\n\t•\tLogical? Yes—#2–#4 jointly support a pattern of indifference → devaluation → coercive control.\n\t•\tParasitic? Partially at best. The data fit dominance-maintenance/invalidating sibling dynamics more than true “parasitism,” which implies dependence on your attention/resources. Your description shows low interest + high control, not high dependence.\n\nIf you want, I can rewrite the three heuristics so they map exactly to devaluation, coercive guilt, and esteem-shaming, without overclaiming “parasitic.”\n"
