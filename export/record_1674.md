My concern is sure I had to communicate what happened in a duress but did I communicate something that was clearly a obvious thing that happened or did I understand more than what others would have experienced - meaning  - would someone else who was similarly driven out have understood what was happenign - they too would have found the directions to follow things like "IC has say on your performance" difficult right? being accused of arguing after doing an ordinary interaction? and they too would have similarly made the connection about what was happening? they would have had the pip hanging in the coures of the weeks and it would have earnestly have really been the circumstances in which they burnt out?
