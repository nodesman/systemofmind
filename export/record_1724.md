What can I do to prevent this happeneing in the future - HR said I should have contacted them sooner after the investigation. This individual was asking for changes unrelated to my story multiple times. Sometimes changes that are not valid in the context at all. Like asing to add a <editable> tag on a entity that canot be made editable. Should I have known that this manager would deflect like this? this had been going on for more than 6 months. i want the next job I take to not be affected like this.
