One time, two girls were in some, I don't know, I think film school, I'm not sure what, but I don't know, they had some social project or something. I was sitting at the cafe and there were a lot of white people there, so to speak, Dutch people or yeah, mostly white people in the cafe coffee company. And these two girls said, uh, I felt more most comfortable asking you. So they came and sat next to me and asked, uh, is there something I can help you with? Which was a very odd question, but I anyway, you know, placated them. They seemed a little nervous, two young girls. So I engaged them in a pleasant conversation and they said, thank you for helping me. They said they were helped. So I felt good about that. But, uh, they started out by asking if I can help you. And then they said, thank you for helping me on the way out. This is a real incident that happened. Don't forget that. They said they felt most comfortable talking to me. And this is also true among a lot of strangers in the coffee company cafe terrace that they were trying to have a social interaction with for some academic reason as a project.
