If the IC was repeatedly requesting changes unrelated to the story what should I have done if not ask the manager for help? There was the point that I should have discussed with him directly. But there were negative interactions with him so it felt unpleasant to have to interact with him directly.  Did I fail in my professionalism by not asking why he is asking for this change when it is not related to the story? does he not know this?
