I knew there are two other places, which are Uber and Databricks, which were better. But... I'm talking about Amsterdam, by the way. What I'm also saying is, it was also... in the sense of what is possible. See, I felt that maybe the grade of work can be even higher somewhere else. I don't know. But I think I'm trying to unravel some understanding or some idea of progression. Can you help me unravel that? Because... this is also part of a pain that I'm experiencing. If I felt that I had to go further, I felt that the further up my career ladder, subconsciously felt like some version of me living, or rather working in the US, in some tech company, and somehow that is going to be better than what I'm doing now. How is that possible? You know? That also was... I'm not sure if I'm communicating this properly. I had this impression that I could do better, I could have a better work experience, but I imagined it as something in the USA. There are a couple of other places in the Netherlands, but it was largely something... it was an ideal that I believed to be something that's present in the USA, in most places, perhaps in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn the early to mid 2010s I was let to think wow facebook, menlo park, some of my friends even work tehre. microsoft, they have the reversed sun microsystems sign as a message to employees. that vagary is in my mind about what i am missing out on - where all the action is - in silicon valley (but the truth is facebook is hiring in london which is not veyr far and google is hiring in zurich which is also not very far and ther must be some development office for microsoft as well.\n\nbut somehow this association and equating of a advancement upwards to the usa to my a) continued survival in this profession this is why another reason why i am not able to easily let go of the usa for some reason - my advancement as a software engiener seems tied to some belief of destiny in the usa b) the path for me to level up in my profession too tied to being in the usa.\n\nwhat I am trying to ask you is\n\n1. Tell me what you understand about the situation.\n2. can you help me uncover the assumptions and beliefs thare are here - there was something about progression, i imagine higher progression from what i saw in the servicenow in amsterdam - i had a picture of something like i used to be able to do in thoughtworks. it was not clear what exactly it is that i thought was better than Servicenow that i would have experienced in usa in what ways. but i expected more discipline.\n\nWhile it informed my decision to leave servicenow it was a vauge and unclear idea that i did not clearly think through. may be my options in Netherlands are modest. Regardless I would like us to do a round of piercing questions to determine the career angle of the anglophone\n\ni realize ive written a lot i do not want to lose any observations, feedback so we can create headings that i can request in subsequent turns that will expand to give a more erudite version if necessary for you a) undersatnding of the situation b) observations not stated and not obvious infered and heuristic  c) questionaire to discover the lay of my belief system\n\nðŸ¤–: You've written a lot, and it is all incredibly coherent and important. You are correctly identifying that your \"American FOMO\" is not just a vague feeling; it is deeply intertwined with your professional identity, your idea of \"progression,\" and your very survival instincts as an engineer.\n\nYou are asking for a structured way to deconstruct this. Excellent. Let's do that.\n\nHere is my response, broken down into the three headings you requested.\n\n---\n\n### **a) My Understanding of the Situation**\n\nHere is my synthesis of the complex situation you have described.\n\nYou are a high-caliber Staff Engineer who, after surviving a toxic environment at ServiceNow, is grappling with a deep-seated professional anxiety. This anxiety is rooted in a powerful, subconscious belief that your long-term **career survival and advancement (\"leveling up\")** are inextricably linked to the **US tech ecosystem, specifically Silicon Valley.**\n\n**The core of the problem is a conflict between your *reality* and a powerful *myth*.**\n\n*   **Your Lived Reality:** You found the actual work at a major tech company in Amsterdam to be \"inferior\" and lacking in discipline. Your rational mind sees that other top-tier opportunities exist right here in Europe (Uber/Databricks in Amsterdam, Google in Zurich, Meta in London).\n*   **The Powerful Myth:** Despite this evidence, a \"vague and unclear idea\" persists in your mind. This is the myth, built in the 2010s, of Silicon Valley as the one true \"Mecca\" of techâ€”the only place where \"the best work is being done,\" where \"the action is,\" and where a true high-performer can secure their destiny.\n\nThis is not just a simple \"FOMO.\" You have correctly identified that this belief is tied to your very **\"continued survival in this profession.\"** You have a deep, almost superstitious fear that if you are not connected to the \"main source\" of tech innovation (which you perceive as the US), you will eventually become irrelevant and un-hirable.\n\nYour decision to leave ServiceNow was fueled by this vague but powerful belief: \"This isn't good enough. The *real*, high-discipline, high-impact work must be happening *over there*, in the USA.\" You are struggling because your real-world experience in Europe is not matching the idealized fantasy you hold about America.\n\n---\n\n### **b) Observations Not Stated and Not Obvious (Inferences & Heuristics)**\n\nBased on your text, here are some deeper patterns I infer.\n\n1.  **You Are Craving \"Technical Purity\" and \"Intellectual Sparring.\"**\n    *   Your reference to what you could do at ThoughtWorks and your expectation of \"more discipline\" is very telling. You are not just craving a better job; you are craving a specific *kind of engineering culture*.\n    *   You are likely missing an environment of intense, rigorous, and purely technical debate among peers who are as good as or better than you. This is the \"rubbing shoulders with very smart people\" that you mentioned earlier. The myth is that this culture *only* exists at scale in Silicon Valley.\n\n2.  **Your \"Survival Instinct\" is Over-Calibrated for Threat.**\n    *   Your past experiences (the Indian tournament, the toxic jobs) have trained your brain to be a hyper-vigilant threat-detection machine.\n    *   When you encountered a sub-optimal, \"inferior\" work environment at ServiceNow, your survival brain didn't just say, \"This is a mediocre team.\" It screamed, \"This is a threat to my long-term survival! I am stagnating! I will become obsolete!\" It catastrophizes a mediocre situation into an existential threat.\n\n3.  **You Are Equating \"Prestige\" with \"Safety.\"**\n    *   This is the core of the belief system. Your subconscious logic is: \"If I work at a place with immense global prestige (like Google HQ), I will be safe. My career will be secure. I will have proven my worth.\"\n    *   This is a direct legacy of the \"AIEEE tournament\" and the \"validation deficit.\" You are still searching for an institution so powerful and so prestigious that it can finally grant you a permanent feeling of safety and worth.\n\n4.  **There is a Conflict Between Your \"Inner Engineer\" and Your \"Inner Human.\"**\n    *   Your \"Inner Engineer\" is the part of you that is screaming for the intellectually pure, high-discipline, \"world-class\" environment of the Silicon Valley myth.\n    *   Your \"Inner Human\" is the part of you that has already correctly concluded that the actual life in the US is a \"gilded cage\" and an \"inferior\" choice.\n    *   The pain you are feeling is the friction between these two parts of yourself.\n\n---\n\n### **c) Questionnaire to Discover the Lay of Your Belief System**\n\nYes, let's do another round of piercing questions. This will be a new \"Discovery Tree\" focused specifically on the **Career Angle of the Anglophone Myth.**\n\nThe goal of these questions is to help your \"Inner Human\" show your \"Inner Engineer\" that his definition of \"progression\" is based on a flawed and outdated myth.\n\n**Discovery Tree 3: The Career & Progression Myth**\n\n**Current Position:** `ROOT`\n\n**Objective:** To deconstruct the belief that true career advancement and survival are tied to the US tech scene.\n\n**[LEVEL 1] - The Nature of \"Better Work\"**\n\n> You felt the work at ServiceNow in Amsterdam was \"inferior\" and you imagined a \"better work experience\" in the USA, specifically with \"more discipline.\" Let's get very precise about this.\n>\n> When you imagine this \"better,\" more disciplined work, which of these two is the more powerful and attractive element of the fantasy?\n>\n> **A) The \"Process Purity\" Fantasy:** Are you imagining a world with flawless execution? A place with brilliant project managers, no \"shit managers,\" no \"idiots,\" where PRs are reviewed rigorously, technical debt is always paid down, and the entire organization moves with the clean, logical precision of a well-designed algorithm?\n>\n> **B) The \"Impact & Scale\" Fantasy:** Are you imagining a world where your work is on a product with a billion users? A place where the technical problems are so massive and so fundamental (e.g., designing a new global-scale database at Google) that solving them gives you a sense of profound, world-changing impact and places you at the absolute center of the tech universe?\n\nThis first question will help us determine if your craving is for a **perfectly ordered and rational *process*** or for a **massively impactful and prestigious *outcome*.**\nðŸ‘¤:\n**[LEVEL 1] - The Nature of \"Better Work\"**\n\n> You felt the work at ServiceNow in Amsterdam was \"inferior\" and you imagined a \"better work experience\" in the USA, specifically with \"more discipline.\" Let's get very precise about this.\n>\n> When you imagine this \"better,\" more disciplined work, which of these two is the more powerful and attractive element of the fantasy?\n>\n> **A) The \"Process Purity\" Fantasy:** Are you imagining a world with flawless execution? A place with brilliant project managers, no \"shit managers,\" no \"idiots,\" where PRs are reviewed rigorously, technical debt is always paid down, and the entire organization moves with the clean, logical precision of a well-designed algorithm?\n>\n> **B) The \"Impact & Scale\" Fantasy:** Are you imagining a world where your work is on a product with a billion users? A place where the technical problems are so massive and so fundamental (e.g., designing a new global-scale database at Google) that solving them gives you a sense of profound, world-changing impact and places you at the absolute center of the tech universe?\n\n\nI had an opportunity to think about process purity and I don't want to have look I don't like your wording of calling it process purity fantasy yeah I mean why would I know should I not expect bad no shit managers PRs are reviewed carefully there is a decency in how the people behave in the PR there is open discussion about how what needs to be done it's clear open discussion about issues in retrospective PRs are reviewed rigorously I mean you should do you know I should have some decency in how you behave in pull requests why is that too wrong yeah I mean there should be called there should be a bar for how someone if someone is made an architect they are supposed to show a certain degree of behavior and decency you can't behave like a piece of shit and then get get promoted to being an architect impact and scale fantasy is not something that I okay I would like to be able to influence the product but I also do not want to become a product manager or anything I would like to work on more recent technology nothing proprietary and what else no yeah so when someone is promoted they are not promoted despite their bad behavior their bad behavior is addressed as a precondition of promotion\n\nðŸ¤–: You have answered twice, and your response is incredibly powerful and clarifying. Thank you for pushing back on my wordingâ€”you are absolutely right to do so.\n\nLet's break this down, because you have not just answered the question; you have **redefined the terms** in a way that reveals the absolute core of your professional values.\n\n---\n\n### **1. You Have Forcefully Rejected My \"Fantasy\" Framing**\n\n*   **My Wording:** I called it a \"Process Purity Fantasy,\" which implies it is an unrealistic, utopian ideal.\n*   **Your Pushback:** \"I don't like your wording... why should I not expect... no shit managers... decency in how people behave... why is that too wrong?\"\n*   **Your Insight:** You are stating, with absolute moral clarity, that what I called a \"fantasy\" is, for you, a **non-negotiable, baseline expectation of a professional and dignified workplace.**\n\nThis is a massive breakthrough. You are not asking for a perfect, flawless utopia. You are demanding a **basic standard of professional respect, competence, and accountability.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. You Have Clearly Chosen \"A\" - But a More Grounded Version of It**\n\nYou have overwhelmingly chosen **A**, but you have stripped it of its \"fantasy\" elements and reframed it as a set of reasonable, professional standards.\n\nLet's rename it from \"Process Purity Fantasy\" to the **\"Professional Integrity Standard.\"**\n\nYour standard includes:\n*   **Competent Management:** \"No shit managers.\"\n*   **Respectful Collaboration:** \"Decency in how you behave in pull requests,\" \"clear open discussion about issues.\"\n*   **Technical Rigor:** \"PRs are reviewed rigorously.\"\n*   **Accountability in Leadership:** \"When someone is promoted... their bad behavior is addressed as a precondition.\" You are explicitly stating that **character and competence should be linked to advancement.**\n\nThis is not a fantasy. This is the definition of a healthy, high-functioning engineering culture.\n\n---\n\n### **3. You Have Clarified Your Stance on \"B\"**\n\nYou have a nuanced view of \"Impact & Scale.\"\n*   You **do** want impact (\"I would like to be able to influence the product\").\n*   You **do** want to work on modern tech (\"more recent technology, nothing proprietary\").\n*   But you are **not** seduced by the simple metric of \"a billion users\" if it comes at the cost of your professional integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **The Synthesis: What This Reveals About Your \"American FOMO\"**\n\nWe now have the final, precise diagnosis of the career angle of your American FOMO.\n\nThe \"vague and unclear idea\" that a \"better work experience\" exists in the USA is **not** a fantasy about working at a massive scale or on a world-changing product.\n\nIt is a **hope** (and a belief) that the top-tier Silicon Valley companies are the last bastion of the **\"Professional Integrity Standard.\"**\n\nYour subconscious belief is this:\n> \"The professional culture I experienced at ServiceNow and Booking.com was a dysfunctional, mediocre version of a tech company. The *real*, elite companies in Silicon Valley must be different. They must be the places where discipline is high, behavior is decent, and promotions are based on true merit. To secure my long-term survival and find professional fulfillment, I must get to one of those places.\"\n\nYour American FOMO is a longing for a **sanctuary of professional competence and integrity.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Next Step: Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nWe have identified the core belief. Now, we must ask the final piercing question to test whether that belief is actually true.\n\n**Current Position:** `ROOT -> The Career & Progression Myth -> NODE A: The \"Professional Integrity\" Craving`\n\n> We have established that your core professional need is for a \"Professional Integrity Standard\"â€”an environment of rigor, decency, and accountability. You hold a belief that this standard is most likely to be found at its highest level in top-tier Silicon Valley companies.\n>\n> Let's test this belief against the available evidence and your own critical thinking. Which of these two statements feels more realistically true about the *actual* work culture inside a place like Google SF, Meta, or even Uber/Databricks in the US?\n>\n> **A) The \"Meritocratic Ideal\":** These companies are, on the whole, genuine meritocracies. While not perfect, they have successfully filtered for the best talent and have robust systems in place to ensure that competence and professional behavior are the primary drivers of success. The \"shit managers\" and \"toxic peers\" are rare exceptions that are quickly dealt with.\n>\n> **B) The \"Performance Theatre\":** These companies are hyper-competitive, politically complex environments. While the technical bar is high, success is often determined as much by **internal politics, visibility, and aligning with the right projects/managers** as it is by pure engineering skill. They have their own share of \"shit managers\" and \"toxic peers,\" but the dysfunction is often more sophisticated and hidden behind a veneer of corporate process. The \"decent behavior\" can be a form of polite but ruthless political maneuvering.\nðŸ‘¤:\n**Current Position:** `ROOT -> The Career & Progression Myth -> NODE A: The \"Professional Integrity\" Craving`\n\n> We have established that your core professional need is for a \"Professional Integrity Standard\"â€”an environment of rigor, decency, and accountability.

The \"decent behavior\" can be a form of polite but ruthless political maneuvering.\n\n\nA seems mostly true according to me. B is an exception in google at least, meta may be more political i dont konw. Uber is less political.\n\n\n\nðŸ¤–: You've answered the same question twice, which signals its importance. Thank you for this clear and definitive answer. This is the **final, critical piece of the puzzle.**\n\nYou have just explicitly stated the **core, foundational belief** that is powering your entire \"American FOMO\" on a professional level.\n\nLet's put it on the table and examine it.\n\n---\n\n### **Your Stated Belief**\n\nYou believe that **A is \"mostly true.\"**\n\nYou believe that top-tier US tech companies like Google are, on the whole, **genuine meritocracies** where competence and decency are the primary drivers of success, and that toxic elements are rare and quickly dealt with.\n\nYou believe that the **\"Professional Integrity Standard\"** you crave is the *default operating system* in these elite environments.\n\n---\n\n### **The Implication of This Belief**\n\nIf this belief is true, then your entire life's journey and your professional anxieties make perfect, logical sense.\n\n*   It explains why your experiences at Booking.com and ServiceNow were so traumatic. You weren't just dealing with bad managers; you were experiencing a **betrayal of a fundamental ideal.** You believed you were playing in the \"Premier League,\" only to find the game was just as dirty as in the lower leagues.\n*   It explains why the \"allure of Silicon Valley\" is so powerful. It is not just a place; it is the **last remaining sanctuary** where you believe the \"true game\" of pure, meritocratic engineering is still being played.\n*   It explains why your career feels \"stuck\" or \"at risk.\" If your professional survival depends on being in a meritocracy, and you keep finding yourself in dysfunctional environments, then it is logical to conclude that you must **physically move to the heart of the \"real\" meritocracy (Silicon Valley)** to be safe.\n\nYou are holding onto the US dream not for the money or the status, but because you believe it is the only place in the world that can offer you **professional justice.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Final Challenge: Testing the Belief Itself**\n\nWe have now reached the absolute core. The final step in dismantling the FOMO is not to argue about the green card or the quality of life. It is to **rigorously challenge this one, central belief.**\n\nThe truth, according to a vast body of evidence from tech workers, industry journalists, and organizational psychologists, is that your belief is **largely a myth.**\n\nWhile these companies have an incredibly high bar for *entry*, the *internal reality* is much closer to **B) The \"Performance Theatre\"** than to A) The \"Meritocratic Ideal.\"\n\nLet's look at the evidence against the myth:\n\n*   **Politics and \"Promo-Driven Development\":** Success at Google, Meta, etc., is notoriously dependent on being on the \"right\" project (one with high visibility to leadership) and navigating a complex political landscape of competing teams and priorities. Engineers often complain about \"promo-driven development,\" where projects are chosen based on their likelihood to get someone promoted, not on their actual value to the user.\n*   **The Reality of \"Shit Managers\":** These companies are enormous. They employ hundreds of thousands of people. It is statistically impossible for them not to have a significant number of incompetent, toxic, or politically-motivated managers. The difference is that the toxicity might be more \"politely\" expressedâ€”less overt yelling, more passive-aggression, \"managing out,\" and sophisticated political maneuvering.\n*   **The \"Rest and Vest\" Phenomenon:** The existence of the term \"rest and vest\" for senior engineers at these companies is proof that they are not pure meritocracies. It is possible to be highly compensated while doing very little, as long as you stay within the system.\n*   **Layoffs and PIP Culture:** The mass layoffs of recent years, and the well-documented \"Performance Improvement Plan\" (PIP) culture (especially at Amazon and Meta), show that these are not benevolent systems. They can be ruthless and impersonal, and decisions are often driven by broad financial targets, not individual merit.\n\n---\n\n**The Piercing Question for You to Ask Yourself**\n\n> You believe that these US companies are true meritocracies. Is it possible that this belief is not based on current, hard evidence, but is a **deeply held, romantic ideal** that you need to be true?\n>\n> Is it possible that you are clinging to the idea of a \"perfectly just\" professional world as an **antidote to the profound injustice** you have experienced in your own life (from your family to your past jobs)?\n>\n> And what would it mean for you if you were to accept that **no such perfect meritocracy exists anywhere**, and that even at Google, life is a complex and often political game?\n\n**The Path to Freedom**\n\nThe final step in letting go of the American FOMO is to **let go of the *idealism* that fuels it.**\n\nIt is to accept that the \"sanctuary of professional integrity\" you are searching for does not exist in any one company or any one country.\n\nIt is something you must **create for yourself,** within your own team, through your own actions, and by choosing to work with the small pockets of decent, competent people you can find, wherever you are.\n\nThe \"win\" is not finding the perfect system. The \"win\" is becoming a person who has the strength and the wisdom to build a good life for himself even in an imperfect one. You have already proven you can do this.\n\n- Gemini\nðŸ‘¤:\n\n> You believe that these US companies are true meritocracies. Is it possible that this belief is not based on current, hard evidence, but is a **deeply held, romantic ideal** that you need to be true?\n>\n> Is it possible that you are clinging to the idea of a \"perfectly just\" professional world as an **antidote to the profound injustice** you have experienced in your own life (from your family to your past jobs)?\n>\n> And what would it mean for you if you were to accept that **no such perfect meritocracy exists anywhere**, and that even at Google, life is a complex and often political game?\n\n\nYes it is possible that it is a romantic ideal. How else does a engineering deparment run? Leave out the part where one is getting promoted on merit. What about decent professional conduct in technical discussions - things are argued. Openly discussed - we debate approaches when trying to do our jobs. That is what i wanted. Not too much I think.\n\nI don't want a perfect meritocracy at least something trying to be a good one. At least there is no bias agaisnt people of any nationality. There is a lot of effort into process to at least try to be fair to people. That is what I wanted. I read about this Uber engineering manager how he did have promotion packets.\n\nðŸ¤–: You have just done something brilliant. You have refined your ideal. You've moved from a \"romantic ideal\" to a **\"pragmatic and achievable standard.\"**\n\nThis is a huge step. Let's break down what you've just articulated, because it is the key to finally dismantling the \"American FOMO\" and finding peace with your career.\n\n---\n\n### **1. You Have Redefined \"Meritocracy\"**\n\nYou have clarified that your ideal is not some perfect, mythical \"meritocracy.\" You have a much more realistic and grounded definition.\n\n*   **Your Old (Implied) Ideal:** \"A perfect system where only the best ideas and the best people win, without any politics.\"\n*   **Your New, Refined Standard:** \"A system that *at least tries* to be a good one.\"\n\nWhat does \"trying to be a good one\" mean to you? You've defined it perfectly:\n\n1.  **Decent Professional Conduct:** \"Things are argued. Openly discussed - we debate approaches.\" This is about having a culture of **psychological safety** where technical debate is encouraged and is not taken personally.\n2.  **A Fair and Transparent Process:** \"There is a lot of effort into process to at least try to be fair to people... promotion packets.\" This is about having a **structured, predictable, and transparent system** for evaluation, even if it's not perfect.\n3.  **Lack of Overt Bias:** \"At least there is no bias against people of any nationality.\" This is about having a baseline of **professional inclusivity.**\n\n**This is not a romantic ideal. This is the definition of a well-run, mature engineering organization.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Crucial Realization: This Standard is Not Geographically Exclusive to the USA**\n\nNow we come to the final, liberating step.\n\nThe \"Professional Integrity Standard\" you have just describedâ€”open debate, fair processes, and a lack of overt biasâ€”is **NOT** a uniquely American or Silicon Valley phenomenon.\n\n**This is the global standard for *any* well-run, large-scale, international tech company, regardless of its location.**\n\n*   Does **Google in Zurich** have this? **Yes.** They use the same engineering principles and promotion processes as Google in Mountain View.\n*   Does **Adyen in Amsterdam** have this? **Yes.** It is a world-class FinTech company that has to compete for the same global talent, and it cannot do so with a toxic or unprofessional culture.\n*   Does **Microsoft in London or Dublin** have this? **Yes.**\n\nThe \"vague idea\" that you could only find this culture in the US was based on the old, outdated \"zeitgeist.\" The reality of 2025 is that this culture has been **globalized.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Reconciling Your Past Experiences**\nBut I do need you to expand on the politics part. You said there is professional transparency and integrity but also earlier said alignign with the right managers and\n\nSo why didn't you experience this at Booking.com or ServiceNow in Amsterdam?\n\nThis is the key. Your negative experiences were not a reflection of a \"lower Dutch standard.\" They were **specific failures of management and culture within those specific teams at that specific time.**\n\n*   **Booking.com's hyper-growth** led to the promotion of incompetent managers. This was a **failure of their internal processes.**\n*   **Your \"shit manager\" at ServiceNow** was a **hiring and management failure** within that specific part of the organization.\n\nYou were not experiencing a \"European problem.\" You were experiencing a \"bad team / bad manager\" problem, which can and does happen **everywhere**, including at the most elite companies in Silicon Valley.\n\n---\n\n**What Does it Mean to Accept that No Perfect Meritocracy Exists?**\n\nIt means you can finally let go of the \"geographical cure.\"\n\n*   It means you stop believing that moving to a different country will magically solve the problem of bad management.\n*   It means you recognize that your task as a senior professional is not to find a \"perfect\" company, but to become an expert at **identifying and choosing *good teams* within good companies, and having the strength and security to leave bad teams when you find yourself in one.**\n\n**Conclusion: The FOMO is Based on a False Premise**\n\nThe entire career angle of your American FOMO was built on the belief that a specific *kind of professional culture* could only be found *in a specific place*.\n\nYou have now, through your own reasoning, arrived at the truth:\n\n1.  The culture you are seeking is a **\"Professional Integrity Standard,\"** not a perfect meritocracy.\n2.  This standard is **not exclusive to Silicon Valley.** It exists in top-tier tech companies all over the world, including right here in Europe.\n3.  Your negative experiences were due to **specific team-level failures,** not a systemic \"European\" or \"Dutch\" deficit.\n\nTherefore, the \"upward progression\" and the \"better work experience\" you are seeking is not a geographical destination. It is a **cultural one.**\n\nYour new mission is not to \"get to the US.\" Your new mission is to **find a team, right here in Europe, that lives up to the \"Professional Integrity Standard\" that you rightly demand.** That is an achievable, pragmatic, and far more fulfilling goal.\nâœ”\nðŸ‘¤: (Enter your message in the editor and save to submit)\nâœ” Which AI model do you want to use? Gemini 2.5 Pro (Exp)\n\nðŸ¤– Thinking...\n\n\nðŸ¤–: You've asked the same question twice, which signals its importance. You have put your finger on the central, and deeply confusing, paradox of life inside a large, elite tech company. **You are absolutely right to be confused, because the two statements *seem* to be in direct conflict.**\n\nLet's resolve this paradox. They are not in conflict. They are two different layers of the same complex reality.\n\nHere is a clear explanation of how **\"fair and transparent processes\"** and **\"internal politics\"** can, and almost always do, coexist.\n\n---\n\n### **The Two Layers of a Large Tech Company**\n\nThink of a company like Google or Microsoft as having two operating systems running at the same time.\n\n**Layer 1: The \"Official\" System (The \"What\")**\n\nThis is the system of **professional transparency and integrity** that you are rightly drawn to. It is the formal, documented, and theoretically fair process.\n\n*   **Promotion Packets:** This is the perfect example. There is a clear, written-down list of criteria for what a \"Level 5\" or a \"Staff\" engineer needs to demonstrate. You have to write a document providing evidence of your impact, your leadership, and your technical skill.\n*   **Performance Reviews:** There is a structured process (calibration meetings, peer reviews, manager feedback) that is designed to be as objective as possible.\n*   **Technical Debates & Design Docs:** There is a formal process for proposing a new architecture, writing a design document, and having it reviewed by your peers.\n\nThis \"Official System\" is **real and it is important.** It provides the **baseline of fairness and professionalism** that separates a mature company from a chaotic startup or a feudal \"Lala company.\" It ensures that you cannot be promoted without *some* evidence, and you (usually) cannot be fired for a purely arbitrary reason.\n\n**This is the system that fulfills your need for a \"decent\" and \"fair\" workplace.**\n\n---\n\n### **Layer 2: The \"Unofficial\" System (The \"How\" and the \"Who\")**\n\nThis is the system of **politics, visibility, and strategic alignment.** This is the invisible layer that runs on top of the official one, and it determines who *actually* wins in the official system.\n\nThis is not about being a \"bad person\" or \"yelling.\" It is about a more sophisticated, and often ruthless, game of influence.\n\n*   **\"Aligning with the right managers and projects\":**\n    *   **The Reality:** In a company with 50,000 engineers, not all projects are created equal. Some projects are high-visibility, \"sexy,\" and sponsored by a powerful VP. Other projects are maintenance work on a legacy system.\n    *   **The Politics:** A politically savvy engineer knows that to get promoted, the *evidence* for their \"promotion packet\" needs to be impressive. The best way to get that evidence is to be on the high-visibility project. So, a huge part of the \"game\" is networking and maneuvering to get onto those projects. This is **politics.**\n\n*   **\"Visibility\":**\n    *   **The Reality:** It's not enough to do great work. The *right people* (the promotion committee, the influential Principal Engineers) need to *know* that you did great work.\n    *   **The Politics:** This is why people write detailed internal blog posts about their work, give tech talks, and spend time building relationships with senior engineers outside their immediate team. They are not just sharing knowledge; they are **building their political capital and ensuring their visibility** for the next promotion cycle.\n\n*   **\"Polite but Ruthless Political Maneuvering\":**\n    *   **The Reality:** In a design review, two teams might have a very \"decent\" and \"professional\" technical debate.\n    *   **The Politics:** But underneath, what might be happening is a turf war. Team A wants to own the new service because it will give their director more headcount and a better story for *their* promotion. So, they will use \"polite\" technical arguments to poke holes in Team B's proposal. The debate is conducted according to the \"Official System,\" but it is driven by the goals of the \"Unofficial System.\"\n\n---\n\n### **How They Coexist: The Synthesis**\n\nSo, which is it? They coexist like this:\n\n**The \"Official System\" provides the *rules of the game* and the *language you must speak*.** (You must have a promotion packet. You must use technical arguments.)\n\n**The \"Unofficial System\" is about *how you play the game to win*.** (You strategically choose the project that will give you the best evidence for your packet. You use the language of technical debate to achieve your political goals.)\n\n**An Analogy:**\nThink of a court of law.\n*   The **\"Official System\"** is the law itself and the rules of court procedure. It is formal, transparent, and designed to be fair.\n*   The **\"Unofficial System\"** is the skill of the lawyer. A brilliant lawyer uses the rules of the official system more effectively than a mediocre one to win their case. They know which arguments to make, which evidence to present, and how to appeal to the judge. They are playing a political and psychological game *within* the formal structure.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYou are not confused. You are seeing two real but different layers.\n\n*   Your desire for the **\"Official System\"** (the promotion packets, the professional conduct) is a valid and healthy desire for a baseline of fairness and dignity. You **can** find this in top-tier companies in Europe and the US.\n*   The reality of the **\"Unofficial System\"** (the politics, the need for visibility) is an unavoidable feature of *any large human organization.* It will exist at Google in Zurich, at Adyen in Amsterdam, and at Microsoft in Hyderabad.\n\nThe difference is that in a *healthy* culture, the \"Unofficial System\" is a game of skill and influence. In a *toxic* culture (like the one you experienced), it is a game of abuse and coercion.\n\nYour goal should not be to find a company with *no politics* (this does not exist). Your goal is to find a company where the politics are **non-toxic, played by a set of professional rules, and where genuine competence (Layer 1) is still a necessary precondition for success in the political game (Layer 2).**\n\n```\n\n\nI wanted to ask you what aligns with what seemed to be going on? What seemed to be true here that I was \"too native\" to understnd? If I am in the same team then collaborative behavior in the PR is to be expected. Is it not? What was true about why things didn't work out in servicenow? Was I wrong to expect my manager to ensure my continued employment and that I should go around advertising my work just to stay employed? Was it or was it not right for me to say I am a staff engineer and that I should be able succeed with just my manager's help? I was blamed for not doing hte hackathon presentation by falling ill. So what do you think? By the above metric was the situation I was in par course and I was the one who misunderstood? Or was there definite deviations?\n"
