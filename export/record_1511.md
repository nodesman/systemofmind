You hold a belief that this standard is most likely to be found at its highest level in top-tier Silicon Valley companies.\n>\n> Let's test this belief against the available evidence and your own critical thinking. Which of these two statements feels more realistically true about the *actual* work culture inside a place like Google SF, Meta, or even Uber/Databricks in the US?\n>\n> **A) The \"Meritocratic Ideal\":** These companies are, on the whole, genuine meritocracies. While not perfect, they have successfully filtered for the best talent and have robust systems in place to ensure that competence and professional behavior are the primary drivers of success. The \"shit managers\" and \"toxic peers\" are rare exceptions that are quickly dealt with.\n>\n> **B) The \"Performance Theatre\":** These companies are hyper-competitive, politically complex environments. While the technical bar is high, success is often determined as much by **internal politics, visibility, and aligning with the right projects/managers** as it is by pure engineering skill. They have their own share of \"shit managers\" and \"toxic peers,\" but the dysfunction is often more sophisticated and hidden behind a veneer of corporate process. The \"decent behavior\" can be a form of polite but ruthless political maneuvering.\n\n\nA seems mostly true according to me. B is an exception in google at least, meta may be more political i dont konw. Uber is less political.\n\n\n"
