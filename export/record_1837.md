  "content": "This company used to work with some level of coterie like behavior - the new manager of this IC after the one who was fired was seen asking a female colleague \"why are you surprised?\" when this IC came from behind and hugged her. I think she was starteld but they were gaslighting her as if she was being too meek or something. i think 6 months later that girl was seen having her hands held by this IC and she seemed to smile and things like that but it is not clear if this is coping or she genuinely likes him being that he has terrible demeanor and dominates. she is 22 years old and naive so what does it seem like is going on? also do you think this new manager is aware of the nature of thee xit of the manager and given that he wsa given this IC to manage does it seem like he was apprised in any capacity about what happened?
