Okay, I feel like I led you in this assessment. Can you please say something that will help me gain confidence in your response? That it was recent. First of all, also talk to me about what I've been struggling to express, you know, if you explain it properly to me, I will feel like I've been heard. And feeling like I've been heard can also can be all the difference. I mentioned many, many, many, many, many, many incidences and observations about him. And I don't feel like you have sufficiently acknowledged and built on to elucidation of his, how the various observations I made, what does that derive into? I need you to make that connection for me. That's what I need.
