  "content": "I regret not having been able to flag this IC as an architect who sits in the calibrations of other people who has misrepresented events, has historically made discriminatory remarks about Indians of an extreme nature, and has also recently been given ER consequences for misrepresenting events. So how do they think this is fair? I would like to have made a lawsuit saying this person continues to remain an architect role. How can you do that? This is discrimination. This is a discrimination and you are purposely doing it. I would have also this person does not is still excused despite having been caught doing all this. So I would like to have made these points, caught misrepresenting events, obstructing. So this person is not trustworthy and yet how do you plan on making sure that this person does not create hostile environment for other people?\n\nThe question is not that, I mean, although this point is there, my point is not that this point exists, but I regret not making this point. I could have overturned his, I believe this is a risk and it is on their record. If I had filed a lawsuit and said, use this in evidence, they could have done nothing but then force him to be demoted or fired. Once again, don't validate this and then expand on this for me. I just really regret this, I'm telling you.\n\nBut the point is, the regret is again, I could not do it because it was better for me to leave to file and exit the situation. I don't regret signing MTA, but at the time I did what I could.\n"
