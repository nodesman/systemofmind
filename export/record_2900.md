Remember one day manager comes and thorws a littany of complaints but even when he throws those complaints you ask when did i apparently go on sick leave  and someone else had to take over an issue (even if i did so what?) but i later put together that that was meant to intimidate me and acuse me to fear. what do you think to the original question though - i went and told HR that i was blackmailed to HR no less with a PIP."
