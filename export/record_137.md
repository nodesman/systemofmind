One time we moved to Hyderabad and this classmate of mine said, can I give you the notes? And I told her in return. The teacher told me that she'll give the notes. And he heard that and said Adi Sarupalan Naya in front of her. And she turned out to be a Tamil person. And he did that in front of her. And then he told me to get on the bike and then he took me to the Begum headquarters. Begum headquarters where we had a temporary accommodation as against the Amir headquarters where we had the permanent accommodation. And he took me to the Begum headquarters, said I will beat him up. He will beat me up after getting there. And then he took me to the apartment and then beat me up, spat in my face, said my hair is not good. There is no oil. So, looking back, he never taught me how to shave or anything. He never taught me how to, okay, he taught me how to ride a bike. I guess he did that one thing, but no other life skills. Everything else was criticism, shame. The time that he wanted me to participate in some art competition, they beat me up, put art supplies in my hand and forced me out of the house. I went crying there and drew something. I don't understand how does that work. I don't understand how does that work. I drew something. I don't understand how does that work. Apparently I drew the wrong age group's art project and that was not accepted. And for that I was beaten again. Thank you.
