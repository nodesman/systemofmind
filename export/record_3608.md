B has 3-4 times the population. The potential contribution of B is that they are demographic labor contributors. When thinking of nation X would people of province A which speak a different language to B and C be proud of B for beign a source of labor? Would they value it? \n\n\nIt's highly unlikely the people of province A would be **proud** of province B, but they would almost certainly **value** their labor on a practical, economic level. The two concepts are very different in this context.\n\n---\n\n### ## Pride: An Unlikely Emotion\n\nPride is an emotional response often tied to shared identity, achievement, and mutual respect. In the scenario you've described, several factors would work against province A feeling proud of province B:\n\n* **Economic Disparity:** The relationship is framed as one of dependency. Province A is the economically developed \"contributor,\" while B is a \"recipient\" of tax doles. This dynamic often leads to feelings of **resentment or a sense of being burdened**, not pride. People in A might feel that their hard work is subsidizing a less productive province.\n* **Cultural and Linguistic Divide:** A different language signifies a different cultural identity. It creates an \"us versus them\" dynamic, making it difficult for one group to feel a deep, nationalistic pride in the primary characteristic of the other.\n* **Perceived Status of Contribution:** Province A's contribution is economic development, which is typically seen as a high-status achievement. Province B's contribution is demographic labor, which, while essential, is often viewed as lower-status. It's rare for a group to be \"proud\" of another for providing something they perceive as less prestigious than their own contribution.\n\n---\n\n### ## Value: A Pragmatic Reality\n\nValue, on the other hand, is about utility and practical importance. The people and industries of province A would likely value the labor from province B in several key ways:\n\n* **Economic Necessity:** The developed economy of province A would need a labor force to function. Workers from province B would likely fill essential jobs in sectors like construction, manufacturing, agriculture, and services that people in province A are unable or unwilling to do.\n* **Keeping Costs Down:** A large labor pool from a less-developed region can help keep wages competitive, which benefits businesses and can lower the cost of goods and services for consumers in province A.\n\nThis \"valuing\" is **transactional, not emotional**. A business owner in province A values the workers from B because they are essential for their company's profitability. A resident of A values the services provided by these workers. However, this practical appreciation doesn't automatically translate into respect for province B as a whole, nor does it erase the underlying tensions caused by the economic and cultural divides.\n\n`````\nGiven this to the national narrative Tamil Nadu contributed something - millenea old trandition.
