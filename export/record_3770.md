Is that the same in India or am I seeing it wrongly. Consent is what is expected evverywhere. Women react to interest that they dont want to entertain right? If I show interest in a girl. She will respond with coldness. I am writing reverything that is in my mind to clarify the thing that is on my mind it is a jumble of thoughts so dont judge me on this position. Women in India too respond to inteerst with either hostility or poor reaction just like in other countries. is that what we are talking about? Or something else?\n"
