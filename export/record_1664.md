You know what else contributed to it? he had 1-1 spaced 1 week apart and did it well in advance. this guy hardly ever puts in the effort to have 1-1 more than once a month and yet this happened? but in that meeting its all about what bothered this guy. it was also him saying "it was going well for a week and now ... you did X." Where X was some other complaint from that IC. so you were doing this for ordinary interactions that i know i did nothing wrong. and based on that reasoned that this whole thing was done as a leverage. 

This combined with the flimsy and contradictory thing he said about not enough tickets and the other things he accused me of were all fake - sick leave, me letting issues go - it seemed like a bunch of things said in order to hurt me including revoking something that was important to me - the team change. so the things that were said here were all specifically aimed at hurting me or cause hurt or disappointment. together with him doing this on purpose - in contrast to the PIP being an outcome and something he was helping me with. 

i did all this non verbally.
