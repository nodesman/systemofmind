It looks like I just lost my job for no fault of my own. And tell me which personalities I should be on the lookout for, specifically, that I can avoid this specific repetition of this specific event, or something. I mean, the root causes. This individual has also been trying to make himself the center of attention in team lunches. So, I have a, okay, maybe it's not NPD, officially diagnosed, but there's a 90% chance that he has NPD. Okay. Is it true then that we go through life looking out for problematic personalities at the workplace, and trying to work around them, identifying and working around them. This is an unfortunate reality of life. Tell me yes. What can I do to avoid specific circumstances that happen like this? Because, just like here, before I was also pushed into burnout in booking.com. There, an individual who was placed in my manager role was making it difficult for me to exist at the workplace. He even made discriminatory remarks about Indians.
