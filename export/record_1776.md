There was a situation where this IC asked me to add <editable> to an entity. Instead of taking him at his word (because I didn't trust him and he has been wrong before) i went and checked by asking in the full company global engineering chat room and asked if that attribute is applicable to that entity. And they said no. This individual seems ot have felt humiliated by it. Did i make a mistake? Should i have let it be, assume that this is without consequence - may be the parser will just ignore it? was my handling not ideal?
