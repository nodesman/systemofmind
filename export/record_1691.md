The other thing, you know, when you do something, what I don't understand is, did he not care if someone is at fault? What exactly do you think? See, when you address a problem, you need to be fair, right? You need to know why, what is going on. That guy keeps complaining. You just take it at face value. Because of trusting him so much. How can you trust a report so much? Is he your friend? I don't know. Would I do it? Yeah, okay, maybe if I have a Tamil report. I'm also Tamil. Would I get into that bias? Maybe. I'm not sure. So do you think he genuinely felt I was at fault for some reason or didn't care? Just socialized the cost?
