Then the trend of the toxicity happened between January and June 2023. I say this trend because the harm was being committed in first half of 2023. But something good was done in march 2022. i didn’t fully appreciate what was happening in first half of 2023. It was not just him but the architect and the director seemed to know. He did mentions something about telling the director that we don’t have enough systems for staff engineers to own. The architect guy also seemed to mention that to me offline away from discussion with this manager. This discussion about the not having enough systems to own is something that was said by my manager to the director is what he told me. From the looks of it it does look like something legitimate to be honest. Although the company has no right to raise the bar in netherlands. That is a different story. Even in early 2023 there  was a conflict for which he did take the effort to mediate. "
