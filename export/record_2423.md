  "content": "Was the framework of trying to change a company every four and a half years while in the Netherlands working in a company like ServiceNow wrong? Was it impragmatic? Did I apply a wrong heuristic for career safety? What do you think of that in the context of the Dutch IT labor marketplace? Combine that with our earlier assessments about the future. I have in fact decided that in the long term I want to become financially free. But I am maybe mistakenly starting to think I am going to do it by enterprising. Like full time, ok maybe that's possible. But perhaps I am being overly optimistic by planning as if it is going to happen. In the short term, meaning in the next 5-10 years, I have to make plans that involve me surviving in the industry. And potentially even thriving after recovering from this situation. So my question to you is, I guess the question is, what is your opinion on..all of this?"
