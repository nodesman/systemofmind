The problem that I am coping with is having a semblance of good will for that person and seeing the most harmful behavior come from them. Was I too gullible trusting him? Did I not have the opportunity to see that this person is capable of it? He would give valid support too - like the tiem I had the conflict with that IC and he said I could say "I disagree" is a legitimate response. that seemed like enough sign of professional legitmacy. he was no inspiring leader. he was just someone who passed down messages. etc.
