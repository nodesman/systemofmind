We know this director said something like \"you are not supposed to say this\" to a architect who said we don't have the apacity for something. most of the managers are people with no technical depth. I want you to make a ist of the observed behavioars and the depth and misunderstanding of ones role based on the statement of the \"architects\", the lack of understanding of roles based upon me asking them are we doing individual commitnments an him retaliating, and pms having abdicated role and snake making product decisions and similary junior donkey (arhictect who said we shold remove data sources in dashboards) doing the same, older architect other than these two are afraid of committing to scope suggested by ux designer due to lack fo frontend knowledge and asking for it to be committed by vp all of a sudden. what do you make of all this? what do you thinkn is the first thing a highly competent engineerin leader will notice and do ?\n"
