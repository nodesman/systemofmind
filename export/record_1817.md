  "content": "I just realized that teh IC was actually a textbook prima donna. Keep in mind that the IC had not established influence. He was infact a senior software engineer and I was staff. I reported his unethical behaviors multiple times. And his problematic behaviors - makign discriminatory remarks at the workplace about other nationalities multiple times. Asking people to shut up,etc. Review the conversation and with the benefit of that additional context and the fact that these peple worked remotely all of them including the manager what does it indicate about why what happened? I feel like i was placed in a no win situration - but i want a balanced answer. i joine a company and am placed in a team and this prima donna does all the things that this conversation history mentions like speaking for the team - and he likely did it without permission from team mates and did it in DM too. so all of this happened without my knowledge much of it - i saw the PM do something similar like just write a one line statement for a story with no body in it. assuming somehow the IC will fill in? but don't be anchored by my leading wording in this. give me your realistic assessment of what you think of what happened to me at the workplace because i go to work and a prima donna joines the team and my work life is affected and i had to nearly sue and get the manager fired and the workplace is ruined how is this fair? how can one go through life when one is able to be affected like this - once again please don't be anchored by this. in order to privetnt that may be it would be good to ask you to first gie me responses of how to approach what i've asked you - what you can do by first elucidating the things you can write in the output that will cause balance - headings and consdierations that will allow the balance to return in yoru response i will ask for your actual response to this quetion in the next prompt. Our earlier attempt was not that successful - what does balanced answer look like in this context? why? think about that too - why i ask is i don't want confirmation of my beliefs but my beliefs are - this pirma donna joined 15 days before me. after a while this manager joined and then this prima donna was praised for \"going after a problem\" just as the aforementioned conversation mentioned then he was made 'staff engineer' which is something else but this manager and moron director gave it. then he started making decisions about the product which i called out when he said 'dont worry about it' and i said its my job to worry about it go into it its not up to him to make product decisions . i am seeing a trend of this manager and other team mates leaning on him and becoming disengaged and dependent and then him misrepresenting events to the manager ending in what happened to me - how in the hell. speaking for the team is something i witnessed him do in a stand up meeting prior to the release. something i wanted to call out.
