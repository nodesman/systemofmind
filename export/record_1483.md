It involves actively unfollowing, muting, or blocking the specific people or accounts that are the biggest triggers for your FOMO. It is about creating a quieter, less competitive digital environment for yourself.\n>\n> **B) The \"Reframe and Re-interpret\" Approach (Offensive):**\n> *   This is about changing how you *process* the information you see. Instead of blocking the triggers, you use them as a cue for a mental exercise. When you see an \"O-1 visa\" post, you consciously and deliberately run through a mental script: \"Ah, there is the signal of performative success. I remember the hidden costs of that path (the French founder's story). I am grateful for the security and balance of my own chosen path.\"\n\n\nI support A fully. I am not yet ready for B I think. The people who landed a O1 managed to get the PR and the citizenship right? So while they dont have bike alnes they made up for it in a walkable city (SF) and high income (SF) and stability (PR, citizeship)\n"
