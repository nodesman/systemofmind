Thinking back to your 20s in India, which of these two strategies was your more dominant, go-to coping mechanism for dealing with this daily reality?\n>\n> **A) The \"Cynical Analyst\":** Did you cope by becoming highly analytical, detached, and critical? By observing the absurdity of the system, judging it, and maintaining a sense of intellectual superiority over the \"stupid uncles\" and \"illiterate\" people? (This is a strategy of **mental withdrawal and judgment**).\n>\n> **B) The \"Angry Fighter\":** Did you cope by becoming confrontational and angry? By yelling and \"breaking things\" to be heard, by getting into fights in traffic, and by feeling a constant sense of rage at the injustices around you? (This is a strategy of **emotional engagement and conflict**).\n\nYour answer will help us understand the specific shape of the armor you built to survive, and how that armor might now be both a source of strength and a potential obstacle to your peace in a very different world.\n\nI did both. I felt I was better than these people. Was I not? I was and still am considerate enough to turn my phone off and not take video calls in a flight that is taking off. Don't see videos on speaker in public. Wear headphones. I always stopped at red lights which others seemed to take the liberty to not. My friend mentioned how this bus guy pushed his bike out of the way in a red light. I didn't identify with them. I felt and thought of myself as being better than them. The people who I identified with were mostly people I moved with at the workplace or in my line of work. \n\nI did become angry by being assertive and expecting the worst in many interactions. Being proactive but not aggressive - I didn't get into fights or take what was not mine or what I didn't deserve but only fought or asked and insisted on getting what I deserved. But I had to be extra smart to get my rightful pound of flesh. Such as other than the examples i already gave you.. this time this usher guy was keeping me from getting to the counter of this prepaid taxi stand of this private company to keep customers from going to the counter by saying that \"fastrack taxi is empty\" i immediately made out that he is an usher and was routing me to those freelancer taxi people. I saw someone who fell for it but I mde out what was going on on the spot, asked him to get out of the way went to the counter and asked for the taxi. Not sure if it is a angry fighter - I assertively asked him to get out of the way and acted with a sense of situational awareness to be happy about. \n"
