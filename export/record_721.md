But monsters hurt you and they are horrific and cause death? or eat you and kill you? or is it weird that i am arguing this?  So justified to call people like my father monster? Or am i arguing proportionality and semantics? What is worse than a monster like someone who murders and maims? I am looking for a word for bad actors and harmful people right? ones to be vary of and managed in real life. and not treated the same as others?\n\n\n"
