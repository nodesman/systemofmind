Here is the thing that happened. This IC contributed to this project that was very critical. Sure I understand that that project is critical and I had to contribute to it. 

He seemed to take issue with me even asking technical questions on the PR about implementation details. He seemed to make a demand and then i would ask a question to clarify to which he would react badly. I asked how the frontend perofrmance test that he was presenting was done and he said he literal stop watch (as against the performance tools in chrome) and ended up reporting to the manager about me having "Argued" .  (he felt embarassed at being outted)

The manager got into a situation where he was creating the perception of a pip at me and then staretd asking me to not do the things that seemed to bother this individual mixed among ohter things that seemed my improvement points for me. And this individual was bothered by my very presence soem times etc. That created a hostile work situation for me and that resulted in me burning out and going into sick leave for 1 year. 

Was this situation something I should have been able to foresee? What can I have done to avoid this situation?
