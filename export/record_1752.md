The mental model I was operating off is - in personal life you have the liberty to walk away therefore you don't chaff for long time. No one is entiteld to be my friend. If you misbehave too many times I am likely to ditch you - (I guess this is premised on personal protocol if I assert and corral who I keep in my life - people come to me with a narrative that places me in some sotry about my value or some notion - like i am inferior to them or i am superior to them etc - if I don't assert that boundary and don't challenge it - then i will accept it and internalize it? therefore even an attempt to tolerate it should be conscious and not be allowed to be interalized in a calculated way?) please tell me if this is all making becuase this is the first tiem i am thikning like this. therefore the unnatural groupings that chaffe happen at the workpalce at best? where am i wrong?
