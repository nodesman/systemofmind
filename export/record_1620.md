**User:**
I just can't believe  that something like this can be done to someone - the first instance of the bullying day when he did the throwing of kitchen sink action i felt really bad - the next day i lost the will to live because i had been through so much in the years prior.  Why would someone do something unethical and inconsiderate and damaging like this to someone else'se life?
