There is a difference between getting ga higher MTA and a Then what woudl my laywer have thought of the outcome that i had her reject it (btw, my lawyer said based on case law they can find our email binding as well when i asked her to decline the MTA that we accepted. i ignored her.  the email that she sent in response to the low ball offer to the company said (on my behalf) 'I discussed your response and counter proposals on behalf of ServiceNow. Although my client disagrees with the statements included in the letter, in order to leave this behind, my client is willing to agree with the settlement proposals referred to in your letter.' and then 3 weeks they left me hanging and then i told the bedrijfarts that i want to talk and to help me get in touch with uwv to fuck sericenow and this i did on saturday she had a official teams meeting witme on wednesday eveneing nd that bitch hr-a sent the law ball mta at wednesday morning and i had it declined the very next day. that is when my lawyer said something about it  being potentially able to be binding based on case law when I had a call with her to decline it. which ignored and had her send the rejection email anyway. To line up the call with her I told her that I want to decline the mTA on monday and she said this seems like something she should talk to me about that is when I told her she should decline it and that is when she’s aid it is potentially bdingin by case law or something.

Please note that this is not really protocol, but I understand that you also just want to close this chapter of ServiceNow.’"
