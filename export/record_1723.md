Does it seem like the manager operated on a clear problem statement? "Raj is doing X" because this one time this IC reported me having merged a PR without this individual's "permission" when his message was posted within seconds of me merging and on github there was no chance for me to see it becuase it isnot like instant message. but he came to the intervening meetings with the belief that i had done something wrong but. he then said okay upon being explained that I didn't see it. So I am some "source" of complaint? What do you make of what the problem statement was?
