This manager said something to the effect of "this IC has say on your performance" in the context of discouraging me from doign something - I was of the impression that someone who is an architect having a say like that entails some responsibility ? this is an engineering department - i am allowd to ask a question to anyone and ask questions all the tiem - or is this an idealistic understanding?
