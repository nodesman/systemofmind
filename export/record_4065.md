  "content": "firstly the act of saying you must have a wife by a certain age and create children by a certain age was to continue the caste system and hinduism etc etc. for a better future a man like me should definitley have children - i have incredibel IQ and intelligence, i also have icnredible hair. I should have children for sure. \n\nmarriage is a responsibility and not something that is fully done for your well being so to speak.. it is not your social security.. its you providing it.. so i maximize for points and satisfaction in my life time.. do i care about hinduism not dying - it is a parasitic system. but islam is raising.. does it seem like i care about that - should i enable hinduism so that islam is kept in check but if both musslims and hindus become rich then modernity will kill bothe religions? religon itself will become minor in peoples lives? but if my life is in nethelrnads permanenty in this life time then.. what is the implication of it? a) for what happens in india.. should i care/ if i have come this far to almost bringing and breaking the hindims down to a system of control and one almost as bad and by my values worse than islam then .. humanity in india is reduced down to just people so why do i care about people in that place more than people here. hardly. there i smore to care about a) my relatives. my brother is actively harmful. father is extractive instrumetor or at least recenty reformed.. i ccan care a bit about cousins. which i do.. but i can contribute to a better european future by having a child and if the plan is to be a good role model then i can be that for anhone.. strangely ive become yathum oore.. \n\nbjut i am choosing to pursue a relationship with a girl that fulfills my spirit. who makes me feel good. that is the plan. \n"
