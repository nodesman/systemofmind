This guy apparently married someone from Thailand, he got divorced, he was associated with again it could be nothing. I don't know. He's a guy from Brazil. Apparently his girlfriend's former boyfriend was some kind of mafia or something in the US. I don't know. How do you even know someone like that, you know, very suspect. I don't know anyone whose friend is a friend of a friend of a friend is a mafia. How are you in such a situation? How are you an engineering manager? How are you? How did this person, you know, end up in a position of software engineering? Anyway, I'm just wondering about what I'm trying to do is have you make pattern recognition, but I don't want it to be very leading. Okay. So look at the behavior that we have seen from this person. I'm just asking why he got divorced. I'm asking what happened. Did he really have a career before in the US? And he seems to have cleared the background check, but I don't know\n"
