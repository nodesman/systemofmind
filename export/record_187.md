If a individual who has a family chooses to treat his family like property in how he deals with them - disrespcts them, beats them all to have his way, including wife, beats children for not getting high enough grades but resists providing coaching classes and such when the child requests it, overrules the choice of the child and tries to force the marriage - what is fair game in this situation - why does someone born in 2024 even in india have to accept that? from an ethical stand point even if someone assumes that this is a highly prevalent issue in india - what is the truth of accepting or tolerating it - if this parent has been known to mostly pay for the school, college and he did eventually pay for the coaching class, when i was debarred from college due tomisconduct on my part he endured 1 more year of college fee payments and even moved my mother to teh city to help me but then its not like he himself move to that city its my mother who moved to that college town. was it a personal sacrifice from him i don't konw but it was not a decision that i was involved in. they felt it was important to do it to get me to finish college i dont understand why. i guess to keep me from bad influences in teh college hostel or whatever. in all fairness i was just out of home and had problems regulating my emotiosn nad did things but that bad thing i did was in college dontk ow how the hostel is anyway related to it. he forced the course and even forced who i was to marry - what is the thinking - how can you be so indecent, rude, as well as do all this - how can he expect to be treated like a father after being so disrespectful? i am trying to ask where to draw the ethical line - is it unusual and out of touch of me to reject this highly indian norm and too out of touch with indian reality by adopting western norm of dignity (or is what i am asking for not even a western norm but even makes sense in the indian context between 1986 and 2009?) (or was it a social class thing - were poor people's parents always like that given my bastard father was brought up poor? i mean indian ones - indina poor - were indain poor people from 1950s until now this crass and treated their families like property? but he is a rbi bank manager - where do we draw the line on him carrying [his own parental family's?] [pooly thought out? - does that eman he is fundamentally a disgusting human being who is disrespectful, has poor manners, uses bad language, is violent?] ) it does not seem like his younger brother was like that.

Although he tried to force the degree I ended up getting computer science degree anyway by some stroke of luck. i worked hard to get an AIEEE. but in all fairness i was about to put in mechanical engineering at the top which would have been dumb because i would have gotten it. he put ECE, EI and CSE - for NIT (warangal, thiruchi) and then VIT in triplicate at the counselling center 

Another thing is the offence was committed over 30 years - through violence and indecent behavior and dominating personal decisions like marriage and courses is it wrong to retroactively hold him responsible if i am pieceing togther all of this at age 38 after having secured my freedom in a foreign country in Netherlands? this is unheard of right? 

what about him having provided financial help after my divorce to pay for legal fees in the netherlands when booking.com fired me â‚¬3000 worth? that was not related to any of his mistakes it was something that happened tome and he offered help. how do afrekenen that in the larger picture?

So it means he is someone who was like a third party? And not a family member? Don't just say yes. Give me a balanced answer. 

He was yelling at my mother while standing up a flight of stairs. Someone who worked for my mother asked him why are you shouting at my mother and he said she is my wife and i will speak however i want. 

Then in anotehr time he spoke to a relative a relative who my mother spoke to who was dismissive of what was happening in my divorce - this relative is my father's borther's wife. apparently when told about what was goign on in my divorce she said "why are you talking about this to me? you should talk to those who were involved in setting up teh marriage" (setting aside the fact that she is literally the wife of my father's brother - who else according to the indian culture structure is "on my side") so when my mother asked about this he said |they are MY relatives" implying there is a distinction from relatives that are also my mother's - so was it fair to ask him to distance themselves from them or is it fair to hold them responsible for that statement?) i will take itno account hte notion that he has old ties with them and needs social connections himself but what about what she said? that means nothng?

Give me headings only for all the things you want to go into and i will request them one by one and you can expand on them step by step. We have a lot ot cover
