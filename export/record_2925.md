  "content": "One anger is how he was able to harm me financially by denying that bonus to me in retaliation. My lawyer said bonuses are discretionary and can be defined for things like for not wearing orange t shirt. He was able to harm me financially and mentally during that period. I went on sick leave and I was not able to make the next 2 bonuses as well. Nor did I get my raise towards the same level as others who seemed to have gotten 10k more pay in base salary. A part of me wonders if he screwed off and didn’t succeed in justifying my performance in calibrations (but he managed to get his toxic IC a promotion right?) I feel bad because others seemed to be getting bonuses but I was not. My useless team mate Ilker was being a tech lead and not doing an additional project for H1 2023 but I was asked to. I wonder if I should have fought back against that. In netherlands you can’t just increase the “bar” randomly.  I did not tell the HR that my bonus was denied. I was already reeling badly to the point of not being able to say everything I wanted to say. But the pain I am reeling from is it looks like other staff engineers were given a salary fo €94k and I was kept at €84 while even some senior software engineers were brought to €87k. This was the year I was abused. But it is possible that I was kept here because of higher stock vests. Or I was neglected. My other question is is it an ongoing effort to ensure you are treated fairly constantly? The lower pay and lower bonus for almost 2 years is €12.6k*2 €10*2 of loss because of buffalo basterd. You tell me, claude? A rational part of me says he turned hostile against me and that is why I lost the bonus. I mangled to make him lose his job, residency and make him uproot his whole family for what he did. I retaliated for that. I feel the blame for not having gotten the lower pay issue addressed either by HR but I was already dealign with the harassment issue and I was on sick leave so what was the pragmatism of going after and this while in sick leave and prior to the investigation? May I could have? It was precarious situation prior to Feb 2024. That swine buffalo’s behavior was such that any loss and defeat to me is what he was aiming for. In all situations I have to let go and I have to lose. But impinge being able to have removed him and made him lose his job. Do you agree that is what happened?  Don’t give me one response. May be you want to give me response to this dense prompt in multiple headings that I can request sequentially? Give me the list of those headings first. "
