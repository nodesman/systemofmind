I’ve repeatedly encountered harmful social scripts (not unique to Indians, but common in some Indian/Tamil settings I’ve experienced): casteist talk, homophobia/transphobia, intrusive marriage/partner policing, status anxiety, gossip-as-leverage, and political contempt. These have harmed my well-being. I want a values-first, privacy-first social life that avoids reinforcing those scripts.\n\nProblem to solve\n\nHow do I minimize exposure to harmful scripts without blanket-avoiding Indians/Tamils, and instead filter people by behavior and values? I also want a default policy of keeping my dating/marital life private (including cross-cultural relationships) until trust is earned—family included.\n\n"
