That’s a coherent, defensible choice for your well-being and for your future family.\n\nHere’s a clear way forward.\n\nThe principle\n\n“Tamil, not caste.” Preserve language, food, art, history, friendships—drop caste as a social identifier or decision tool.\n\nHow to operationalize it\n\t1.\tFamily charter (one line):\n“We don’t disclose, ask about, or organize life by caste. We’re Tamil by culture; caste is irrelevant here.”\n\t2.\tNames:\nUse a surname without caste signaling (e.g., “Cholan”). Avoid caste-coded initials/surnames. Keep it consistent on all public profiles.\n\t3.\tDisclosure policy:\n\t•\tWith anyone: “We don’t do caste in our family.”\n\t•\tIf forms ask in India: leave blank if optional; otherwise select General/Unreserved and do not pursue a caste certificate.\n\t•\tDon’t debate; repeat and move on.\n\t4.\tDocuments (India edge cases):\nNot having/knowing a caste mostly just means you won’t claim reserved-category benefits. Everyday life, school admissions (unreserved), jobs, travel, property—still fine. If your child ever later chooses to document ancestry, they can pursue it with evidence; you’re not locking them out of life, only opting out of caste benefits.\n\t5.\tScripts for relatives/community:\n\t•\t“We don’t keep caste in our home.”\n\t•\t“Please mark ‘General’; we don’t have a caste certificate.”\n\t•\t“We won’t discuss caste—let’s talk about something else.”\n\t•\tIf pressed: “Boundary for our family. Thanks for respecting it.”\n\t6.\tCulture without caste:\nTeach Tamil (reading/speaking), history, literature, music, films, festivals—minus hierarchy. Curate books and kid spaces that are explicitly anti-discriminatory.\n\t7.\tSchools & circles (NL/EU):\nChoose communities that are values-forward (language classes, arts, sports, tech clubs). If caste talk crops up, use the script once; if repeated, reduce access.\n\t8.\tFor your child visiting India:\nPrep a simple line they can own: “We don’t use caste in our family.” Give them permission to change the subject or step away.\n\nTrade-offs (so you’re not surprised)\n\t•\tYou say no to reserved-category advantages. That’s intentional.\n\t•\tSome people will be confused or annoyed. That’s their script, not yours.\n\t•\tYour child gains clarity. One standard answer, everywhere.\n\nMy take\n\nYou’re aligning identity with mental health and ethics. That will age well. Keep the stance simple, repeatable, and boring—no debates, just policy. Pair it with your values-first social curation and you’ll have a Tamil home with zero caste gravity.\n```\n\n\nwhat happens? i anyway was unreserved in aieee. so what chagnes really? \n"
