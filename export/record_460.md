How else can I resurrect my rightful izzat -of being in a high calibre, high paying job? That which I lost in servicenow? (It’s not a high calibre job but a high paying one) I’ve spent 8 years in netherlands and now I have no choice but to continue building. It is like I was forced to leave and go to the Netherlands. It was nearly involuntary. You disagree right? What is the pragmatic truth about going back to India having ‘healed’? I will have to build retirement contributions in India for 8 yers which I do not have. I have to rebuild a life in India if I come back and catch up on retirement savings and to what joy - inferior standard of living and not being able to access the rest of the world through a superior passport and currency. So what do you make of all this?"
