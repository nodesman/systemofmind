OK, so that has to be a goal of its own. Which is not a bad idea, but it's still something you have to do, which brings us to the idea that perhaps I'm just very confused. I would against be a strategic error.. Somehow, let's say you do it. That will still come at the expense of my having lived a full happy life and happiness. So yeah, so you have to let go of that, I really think I should let go of this interest in having a very positive Tamil impact or anything. See one thing I can do is make a website about the Chola Empire, make a website, maybe yeah those things I can do.\n"
