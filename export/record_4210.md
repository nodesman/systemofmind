What can you do to challenge me or say, what shall we take in detour to see if those things are stressed as the edges, so to speak, in our analysis so far? List a few if you can, and then we can based on that, see if what you're saying is what I did make up and know my direction was indeed correct. It'll blow my mind if I got it all correct. Do I have that much of precision?\n"
