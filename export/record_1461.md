So it seems like a degeneraet or lower class who has access to the internet and can speak english. This may take a strange turn for you but when I look at adult entertainment for my enjoyment. and those voices come into my mind.. \n\nwhich is going to tkae another unexpected turn. which is it to say my fellow citizens are europeans not Indians. \n\nthere were things about Indian identity and even Tamil identity that I hated and things i distanced myself and coped with being in that society by identifying with being more like in a foreign country. This was even true even if there was no tangible prospect of me at the time to leave the country. there was this thinking that i will eventually leave but i was also disliking the state of things there. it would be good to unravel what those things were. it would help unravel the anglophone identification, it will unravel the american fomo that i am in pain about and have not fully processed clealry, and it owould help form a new identity in netherlands that is positive and whole and sustainable. Can you ask me questions that will help \n\nI would like you to list the high level headings i can request in subsequent messages that are going to be like an attempt at getting targetted questions to clarify these issues\n"
