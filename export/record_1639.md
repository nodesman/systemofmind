In the investigation report this manager seems to have said I was hired at higher level than the IC and thereofre I may have felt diffiuclt to take "directions" from an IC. My comment : he is eminently aware of the full history of this IC and me. He is the one who in 2021 hit this IC's performance upon my performance review feedback on his comments on colonialism. 

Why do you think this manager thought what he did will work? Saying things like this IC has say on my performance (and therefore? was he not adequately appraised of the responsibility that this entails?)
