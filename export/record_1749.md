Did the emotional impact from this toxic individuals' behavior and me not "putting that behind"  - am I wrong i have seen him in that light of that behavior? It's not like someone else at the workplace left that behind either? 

Does individuals with NPD not get tired? how can someone be insufferabley repeatedly incorrigible? despite repeatedly being told? I've repeatedly told him not to obstruct me in the PR and had to repeatedly escalate to the manager and yet he kept doing it - he was this manager's favorite and definitely had NPD for sure - why do this?
