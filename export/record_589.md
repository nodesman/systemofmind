When i cmae here to thanjavur in 2024 he seems to have been using it and i found the backrest nearly unscrewed but not fully unscrewed, i tried to put it gether and it was not able to be puttogether the screw seems to have been improperly unscrewed but not fully. the backerest was moving loosely i asked him what happened in 2025 and he said i didn't do anything. i told him on the phone in 2024 that he had ruined teh chair. i found a new chair in the house in 2025. i asked him what happened and he said may be your uncle did something (who doesn't live here, why would he do something?)"
