Like they have a claim on the trajectory of those societies and who polish people let in and don't let in? I don't even mean the American state. I mean everyday americans on social media. But i owuld appreciate if you go into unspecificed speifics in this propmt like ususal talking points if you agree to giv eyour response more credibility with me that youa re talking about the same phenomenon. But if you don't see it then don;t make things up. i can torture and bring anything otu of you but will you mention a talking point that i have seen but have not mentioend but will bring up on your own? lets see. \n"
