Can you imagine the circumstances underwhich I went on sick leave? when the things he discouraged that the IC took issue with extended to ordinary interactions? So the only way for me to win is by not playing I did not go on sick leave upon detecting what was going on but i did see that what was going on was being don deliberately a shift from him doing his best to help me prior. So what would have happened had I come back he kept the PIP tentative on July 21. How would I tell HR what? Do you follow?
