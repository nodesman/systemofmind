Here is the confusion a bit - this person doesn't seem to have "meant this much harm" in terms of effect but of course it caused this much harm and you should have known that. So given that - how would you respond to this? this is a nuanced question. How do i reconcile this - "oh you didn't mean to cause this much harm? oh then you are forgiven!!!! xoxoxo" or "how the fuck did you not konw this ?"
