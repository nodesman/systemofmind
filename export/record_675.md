And yet.. my brother neither has empathy for me but aligns with my father. And he himself becomes soemthing of a sadist and doesn't take pleasure in my successes. I thought normal beahvior of a human being is if you were born in a bad situation and you made it out you try to help your younger brother and take happines in his succeses. I don't remember ever rubbing it in his face or being arrogant about it. \n"
