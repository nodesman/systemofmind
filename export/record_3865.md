But we can deal with that then right? I am not ever goign to live in Iran. I am not ever going to live in Brazil and carry a gun to make sure I am not attacked during transit why am I looking into this? \n\nYou said I am not going to do well with “ A life of aimless wandering between your home, a coffee shop, and a park is not a fulfilling existence for a high-agency man like you. It is a recipe for depression.”\n\nWhat choice to I have? I can go to OBA Oosterdokskade I guess. \n\nWhy are you calling it peace time because compared to the rest of the world - people in the USA, India who are back into war time right? In terms of needing to transit? China? There too? You make it sound like this peace time is something to do with my point in life and not place where I live? \n\nBut I guess OBA is my only true option. Or the many OBAs in the area. \n\nPlease clarify and respond the questions I asked. \n"
