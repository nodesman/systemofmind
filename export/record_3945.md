I cannot be delusional and think I am now in India. May be bsaed on emerging threats I may decide to sell my house and leave and og osmehere else. But those threats have not materialized thus far. I don't think europe is goign to go to shit in this geopolitical change. though they are doign a damn good job of squandering. I am unlikely to change some beliefs like the sun rises in the east. May be if that changes i will change it. Most of my beleifs are based in truth. Including my perception of myself. \n\nSo I am tryin to deterine what is the thing that is not something that should not be changed at this point that is not involuntary and not based in fact. \n"
