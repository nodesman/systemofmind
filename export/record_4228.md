But is India culpable? \n\nYou said those behaviors were normalized (by that you mean there were a lot of people who did something liek that to their children). Yes it did not require it. \n\nWhich of these statements was true then:\n\na) it was a affordance not to endure that in india - to not be harmed at home like this (if so what is the culpability of the culture?)\nb) it was not considered abhorrent - sometihng that your neighbor would tell others about - to harm your children like this (if so what is the culpability of culture)\nc) You are saying lack of warmth and kindness and love is both a cultural culpability of india and personal culpability of my father?\nd) since we are saying the culture itself was one where autnomy and respect ws not respeted then it was a low self esteem culture?\ne) the attempted overruling of arranged marriage was a culpability of? \nf) your statement that the culture didn't require it is confusing are you saying that it is a failing even within indian culture or not? (it is confusig to reconcile you saying it doesn't require those behaviors when you say it is also normalized )\n"
