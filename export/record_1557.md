This is a new realm of factor that I have to take into it seems. What if anything is there fore me to take anything forward - in how i judge this person - this eprson chose to act harmfully in a way that was very hard to detect. They curated documentation to harm me. I was able to detect it due to my long memory and knowing there are loopholes in his story and not engaging with him. This is a very strange dynamic that I do not kwon how to prevent in the future and how to look out for.
