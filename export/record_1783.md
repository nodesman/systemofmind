I don't know if I asked this question before, but did they, there is a, see I'm operating off the assumption or that, okay. Did this manager know about the problematic behaviors of this individual and choose to not give it enough attention or did he, did he not know or did he know and not care? If so, would they have told him what is likely to have been more likely to be true and what would they have told him in firing him? I'm more interested in the last part in detail.
