It gets to the very heart of the subcontinent's political history and the distinct identity of the Tamil region.\n\nTo answer directly: For the vast majority of history prior to 1947, **Tamil Nadu was NOT under the same sovereign as the regions of UP, Bihar, and Rajasthan.**\n\nThe periods of unified rule were relatively brief, often incomplete, and were the exception, not the rule. The only period of long, stable, and comprehensive political unification was under the British.\n\nHere is a chronological breakdown of the key periods:\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Ancient Period (e.g., Mauryan Empire, c. 322–185 BCE)\n\n*   **North India:** The Mauryan Empire, with its capital near modern-day Patna (Bihar), controlled almost all of northern and central India, including the regions of UP, Bihar, and Rajasthan.\n*   **Tamil Nadu:** The Mauryan Empire **did not** conquer the Tamil heartland. The three great Tamil kingdoms—the **Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras**—are mentioned in Emperor Ashoka's edicts as independent, neighboring entities with whom the Mauryans had diplomatic and trade relations. Mauryan influence reached the Deccan, but the core Tamil lands remained sovereign.\n\n**Verdict:** **NOT UNIFIED.**\n\n### 2. The Classical & Early Medieval Periods (e.g., Gupta Empire, Chola Empire, c. 300–1200 CE)\n\n*   **North India:** This era was dominated by northern powers like the Gupta Empire and later the Rajput kingdoms.\n*   **Tamil Nadu:** This was the golden age of the Tamil empires. The **Pallavas** and later the imperial **Cholas** were the dominant powers in the south. The Cholas, at their peak, were a major maritime power and even campaigned as far north as the Ganges River, but they never established lasting rule over North India. The power flow was often from south to north, not the other way around.\n\n**Verdict:** **NOT UNIFIED.**\n\n### 3. The Delhi Sultanate (c. 1206–1526 CE)\n\n*   **North India:** The Sultanate controlled the entire Gangetic plain (UP, Bihar) and large parts of Rajasthan.\n*   **Tamil Nadu:** This is the **first time** a northern-based power successfully subjugated parts of the Tamil country.\n    *   Alauddin Khalji's general, **Malik Kafur**, led devastating raids deep into the south, sacking Madurai in 1311.\n    *   The Tughlaq dynasty later established more direct, though turbulent, rule, even creating a separate **Madurai Sultanate**.\n*   This period of northern control was fiercely resisted, was never fully stable, and was relatively short-lived. It was ended by the rise of the southern-based **Vijayanagara Empire**.\n\n**Verdict:** **BRIEFLY AND UNSTABLY UNIFIED** (for a few decades in the 14th century).\n\n### 4. The Mughal Empire (c. 1526–1857 CE)\n\n*   **North India:** The Mughals had their heartland in UP, Bihar, and Rajasthan and established a long, stable rule there.\n*   **Tamil Nadu:** The Mughal conquest of the south was a slow, grinding process that was never fully completed.\n    *   Under **Emperor Aurangzeb** in the late 17th century, Mughal authority reached its southernmost extent.\n    *   They controlled the region primarily through proxies like the **Nawabs of the Carnatic (Arcot)**, who were officially Mughal governors.\n    *   However, their direct control was often contested by local powers like the Marathas of Thanjavur and other local chieftains (*polygars*). The further south you went from Arcot, the weaker the Mughal authority became.\n\n**Verdict:** **PARTIALLY AND INDIRECTLY UNIFIED** (primarily under Aurangzeb, through suzerainty rather than direct rule).\n\n### 5. The British Period (c. 1757–1947)\n\n*   **North & South India:** This is the **only period** where both Tamil Nadu and the regions of UP, Bihar, and Rajasthan were brought under a single, effective, and long-lasting political sovereign.\n*   Through the mechanism of the British East India Company and later the British Raj, the entire subcontinent was administered under one centralized authority. Tamil Nadu was a core part of the **Madras Presidency**, while the northern regions were part of other presidencies or provinces (like the United Provinces).\n\n**Verdict:** **COMPREHENSIVELY UNIFIED.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Period | Ruling Power's Base | Status of Unification with Tamil Nadu | Nature of Rule |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Ancient (Mauryan)** | North India | **No** | Remained independent kingdoms |\n| **Classical (Gupta)** | North India | **No** | Remained independent kingdoms |\n| **Delhi Sultanate** | North India | **Yes (Briefly)** | Brief, unstable, and violently contested |\n| **Mughal Empire** | North India | **Yes (Partially)** | Indirect rule via vassals; never fully consolidated |\n| **British Raj** | Britain | **Yes (Completely)** | Direct, long-term, and centralized administration |\n\nIn conclusion, for almost all of its recorded history before the British arrival, the Tamil region maintained a distinct political sovereignty, separate from the major empires of North India."
