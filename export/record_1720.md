I got this from you in another conversation. Pasting here as a sample:

```
Engaging in prolonged emotional manipulation, such as instilling fear to control someone over time, can be seen as the psychological equivalent of certain physical actions that exert control, harm, or cause lasting impact. Here's how such behaviors translate into physical terms:
1. Psychological Manipulation as a Form of Psychological Assault

    Equivalent Physical Action: Repeatedly poking or jabbing someone in the same spot over time.
    Why: It creates a persistent, accumulating effectâ€”small acts may seem harmless initially but cause significant pain or damage when sustained over time.

2. Instilling Fear as a Control Mechanism

    Equivalent Physical Action: Holding a weapon near someone without using it.
    Why: The mere presence of a threat creates a sense of constant danger, leading to compliance out of fear, even if no immediate harm occurs.
```

Give me an equivalent script of what my manager and the IC did here after reviewing the whole convesation
