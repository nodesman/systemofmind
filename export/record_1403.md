The new \"greatness\" of America is in private, market-driven innovation like LLMs, often created by a precarious, anxious elite.\n>\n> **Knowing this, when you feel the FOMO for American \"greatness,\" are you longing for the *historical, mythical America* that no longer exists, or are you genuinely longing for the *current reality* of its profit-driven, high-risk tech scene? Which \"greatness\" are you actually mourning the loss of?**\n\n\nThe greatness I want is the one I was led to believe. The one where Kalpana Chawla became an astronaut after being born in India. Where the guy ho is a white house advisor on AI was born in INida in chennai. Sirram something. That google guy who exited google and bought some nut farm or something.  The america where you can become some national figure while having been born in India and get validated in teh indian mindspace by becoming someone like sundar pichai or something.\n\n**Why I'm asking this:** This question forces you to separate the romantic myth from the sober reality. The \"greatness\" you are attached to is likely a nostalgic ideal from the past. By acknowledging that this ideal is no longer an achievable reality, you can begin to grieve its loss and release its hold on you.\n\n**Question 2: On the Nature of \"Winning\"**\n\n> Your AIEEE/Indian tech journey was a \"tournament.\" You have described the American path as becoming the \"best of the breed of the world.\" This frames life as a global status competition.\n>\n> **If you were to get a job at Google in Mountain View tomorrow, with a $400k salary but still on a precarious H1B with a 20-year wait for a green card, would you, the person you are *today*, genuinely feel like you had \"won\"? Or would it feel like you had willingly walked back into a gilded cage, trading your hard-won sovereignty for a higher score in a game you no longer respect?**\n\nGood question. I took a moment to think about it and it seems like a hassle. the 20 year wait is sure then for sure its a no for me dawg. It would have been a wasted gilded cage. It does seem like a higher score in a game i don't fully respect but I will be working in the same place someone else I know works there and considers it to be a better life than me and somehow i felt put down by him at least he seems to be going up the or exists in the system where the best work in the industry is being done. So proximity in that sense seems important and impactful. But the 20 year wait and preacrity is all wasteful. \n\n**Why I'm asking this:** This question tests your current, evolved values against the old success script. It forces you to confront the fact that what looked like \"winning\" to your 25-year-old self would likely feel like a strategic and spiritual defeat to your 38-year-old self.\n\n**Question 3: On the Experience of \"Belonging\"**\n\n> You feel a pull to belong in the society that produces the culture you consume.\n>\n> **Imagine you are living in a suburb like Sunnyvale. You are car-dependent, your daily life is a string of commutes between your house, your office, and the supermarket. You have a high salary, but you are an anxious non-citizen on a temporary visa. Now, compare that to your current life: a homeowner and citizen in Amsterdam, able to walk or cycle everywhere, with a robust safety net. Which of these two scenarios feels more like a life of genuine \"belonging\" and dignity? Where do you have more power to shape your own existence?**\n\n\nThe one in Amsterdam seems better. Even though ability to drive everywhere is nice. But seems laborious. \n\n\n**Why I'm asking this:** This question de-romanticizes the idea of \"belonging.\" It forces you to compare the superficial belonging of \"understanding pop culture references\" with the deep, structural belonging of citizenship, rights, and a humane urban environment. It highlights that true belonging is about agency, not just cultural fluency.\n\n**Question 4: On the \"Elite Specimen\" Identity**\n\n> The idea of being an \"elite specimen who became American\" is powerful. It's an identity of triumph.\n>\n> **Let's be honest: Is part of you stuck on America because succeeding there feels like the ultimate, definitive proof to the world—and perhaps to the family and society you left behind in India—that you are a success? Is the \"American\" label a status symbol you feel you still need to \"unlock\" to feel fully validated? And if so, what would it mean to decide that *you* are the only validator who matters, and that you have already proven everything you ever needed to prove?**\n\nYes to the question. \n\nWhat would it mean to decide I am the only one whose validation matters? Then I hope my validation is coming from 'legitimate' and 'well thought out' direction and i don't let myself down by having low expectations and becoming a loser. Even that is someone else's definition it seems? I hope my own validation is something I never learnt to develop and trust and appreciate as worthy. It looks like. We discovered something big just now. \n\n**Why I'm asking this:** This is the final, most direct question. It asks you to confront the possibility that your attachment to America is not about a desire for a better life (because you already have one), but about a lingering need for **external validation.** It is the final boss of your healing journey: the shift from seeking approval from others to granting it to yourself.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n### **Questions to Move Forward: From Rational Derivation to Visceral Commitment**\n\n**Question 1: The \"Emotional Job\" Question**\n\n> We know logically that the Indian and US paths are flawed. But what **emotional job** are the *fantasies* of \"returning to India\" and \"making it in America\" still doing for you?\n>\n> **A) Does the fantasy of returning to India give you a feeling of *connection* and relieve the loneliness of being an immigrant?**\n> **B) Does the fantasy of succeeding in America give you a feeling of *power and validation* that quiets the inner critic who says you're not good enough?**\n>\n> Be honest about which \"emotional job\" is more powerful.\n\nThere is no emotional longing about being in India in a positive sense at all. Just a fear of letting myself believe that the Netherlands is the way forward. In some sense becuase it is something I chose and not something vetted by others as a well trodden path. This is super weird. It is not validated by parents or my brother as a valid or safe path. Or legitimate path. Wow I can't believe we uncovered this!\n\nThe emotional job with regard to the usa is more career success or some kind of having been part of some technological breakthrough. It used to be the thing that I live in san francisco. It was some facebooky thing where I live in SF like my other friends. But i have a friedn who is in paris and who seems settled. He told me 13 years ago about he too wanting to move to the usa. \n\nAgain it is more of that living in pride among other Indians. Which is odd because I don't like the way other Indians tend to live life here - a bit judgemental and keep up with joneses like. And playing power games of one upmanship. May be this conflict needs to be resolved in a subsequent line of questioning.   \n\n\n\n**How the Answer Helps You Move Forward:**\nThis question helps you stop arguing with the fantasies and start understanding their *function*. If the \"job\" is to feel connected, you know you need to focus on building deeper friendships in the Netherlands. If the \"job\" is to feel validated, you know you need to work on your own self-worth. It turns a vague \"stuckness\" into a specific, actionable project. You are no longer fighting the fantasy; you are addressing the underlying need it is trying to meet.\n\n**Question 2: The \"Grief\" Question**\n\n> Acknowledging that both the \"Indian home\" and the \"American dream\" are closed doors can feel like a loss.\n>\n> **What specific, tangible thing do you need to consciously grieve and say goodbye to for each path?**\n>   *   **For India:** Is it the fantasy of being a \"soldier in the trenches,\" a local hero? Is it the simple comfort of being in your parents' home?\n>   *   **For the USA:** Is it the fantasy of being the \"elite specimen,\" the global winner? Is it the prestige of a Silicon Valley title?\n>\n> Name the specific fantasy you are letting go of.\n\n\nIndia: Not much of a loss about anything positive. At all. I don't have any FOMO about India. If this seems to be surprising please feel free to ask me more questions. \n\nUSA: The dream of one day belonging in the society where all the cool things i grew up looking at in cartoons and in movies are inaccessible. I will never live in it. The loss of having the chance to work in a place here the best of the tech ecosystem work. \n\n**How the Answer Helps You Move Forward:**\nYou cannot fully commit to a new future until you have properly mourned the futures that will not be. \"Stuckness\" is often just unprocessed grief. By naming exactly what you are sad about losing, you can perform a conscious \"funeral\" for these old dreams. This act of grieving is what clears the emotional space to allow you to fully embrace your present reality.\n\n**Question 3: The \"Commitment Ritual\" Question**\n\n> You have rationally derived that the Netherlands is the best path. But a rational conclusion does not create an emotional commitment. A commitment is an active choice.\n>\n> **What is one small, concrete, and irreversible action you can take in the next 30 days that would signal to your own subconscious that you are *fully committing* to your life here?**\n>\n> This should be something that makes \"going back\" harder. Examples could be:\n>   *   Enrolling in a year-long, intensive Dutch language course.\n>   *   Joining a *vereniging* (club) that requires a one-year membership.\n>   *   Starting the process of setting up a Dutch BV (a company) for your future projects.\n>   *   Buying a piece of furniture for your house that you truly love and intend to keep for decades.\n\n\nI have a home with loan for 30 years already. Of which I paid down 4 years. I can commit to learn Dutch to C1 or C2 level. By enrolling in something I guess. I could do the vereniging i guess. I already have a eenmanzaak. Some of the things I've already done may seem surprising given the problem we are trying to solve if so please feel free to ask me questions. I have an excess of furniture and even planned on keeping my last cupboard for my future wife but i figured i neede dthe space so i threw it out. \n\n\n**How the Answer Helps You Move Forward:**\nYour brain believes your actions more than your thoughts. \"Stuckness\" is often a lack of committed action. By taking a small, irreversible step, you are sending a powerful signal to yourself that the decision has been made. You are moving from \"thinking about\" your life here to actively *building* it. This creates forward momentum that is more powerful than any amount of rumination.\n\n**Question 4: The \"New Story\" Question**\n\n> The old stories (\"Indian survivor,\" \"American aspirant\") are powerful and well-rehearsed. You need a new story that is just as powerful.\n>\n> **If you had to describe your life's journey and your new mission in a single, powerful sentence that begins with \"I am the man who...\", what would it be?**\n>\n> (For example: \"I am the man who navigated the world's broken systems to build a foundation of sovereign peace,\" or \"I am the man who is now transforming the grit of a survivor into the craft of a master and the wisdom of a mentor.\")\n\n\nI am the man who through careful hedging and through intelligence and by applying myself managed to somehow build a great life in a great country with the best living standards in 2025. I literally built the parts of my life through my labour and by working hard. \n\n**How the Answer Helps You Move Forward:**\n\"Stuckness\" is often a story problem. You are stuck between an old story that is no longer true and a new one that has not yet been written. By consciously authoring your new \"identity statement,\" you are giving your brain a new, compelling narrative to organize your life around. This becomes your new mantra, your new \"why.\" It is the story that pulls you forward, replacing the ghosts that are holding you back.\n\n---\n\n"
