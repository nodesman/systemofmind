  "content": "Of course. This is an excellent idea. You are asking for a practical diagnostic tool—a \"personality profiler\"—based on the sophisticated framework we have developed. This questionnaire is designed to be shared. It avoids jargon and uses simple, scenario-based questions to reveal a person's deep-seated operating system.\n\nHere is a questionnaire designed to map a person's position on the **Axiological Axes** and to identify their dominant **Strategic Operating Model.**\n\n---\n\n### **The Worldview Profiler: A Questionnaire**\n\n**Instructions:** For each question, choose the answer that reflects your most natural, gut-level instinct, not necessarily what you think is the \"right\" answer.\n\n---\n\n#### **Part 1: Discovering Your Core Values (Axiological Axes)**\n\n**Axis 1: Self vs. Tribe (Sovereignty vs. Communion)**\n1.  A life-changing career opportunity opens up in a new city, but it would mean moving away from your aging parents who rely on your presence. What is your primary internal conflict?\n    *   **A)** The immense guilt of prioritizing my personal ambition over my duty to my family.\n    *   **B)** The frustration of my family's needs potentially limiting my own sovereign life path.\n\n**Axis 2: Truth vs. Harmony**\n2.  You are in a team meeting, and your boss proposes a plan that you know is deeply flawed and will likely fail. What is your bigger fear?\n    *   **A)** Creating conflict and damaging the team's morale by pointing out the flaws.\n    *   **B)** Staying silent and allowing a bad decision to proceed, violating my professional integrity.\n\n**Axis 3: Power vs. Service**\n3.  When you think about your ultimate career goal, which of these feels more fulfilling?\n    *   **A)** Building something of immense value, serving a community, and alleviating a major problem in the world.\n    *   **B)** Achieving a position of significant influence, control, and strategic power in your field.\n\n**Axis 4: Progress vs. Tradition**\n4.  You inherit a beautiful, historic family home that is impractical for modern life. Which path feels more natural to you?\n    *   **A)** To carefully preserve the house as a tribute to your heritage, even if it's inconvenient.\n    *   **B)** To respectfully document its history, but then sell it to fund a new, modern home that better serves your future needs.\n\n**Axis 5: Mastery vs. Experience**\n5.  If you were given a one-year, fully-funded sabbatical, how would you be more likely to spend it?\n    *   **A)** Traveling the world, meeting new people, and immersing myself in different cultures and experiences.\n    *   **B)** Dedicating myself to the disciplined, solitary pursuit of mastering a single, difficult skill (e.g., learning a language, coding, a musical instrument).\n\n**Axis 6: Security vs. Freedom**\n6.  You are offered two jobs. Job A offers a moderate but extremely secure salary with a guaranteed pension for life. Job B offers a much higher potential salary but is a high-risk startup that could fail in a year. Which do you instinctively lean towards?\n    *   **A)** The stability and predictability of Job A.\n    *   **B)** The possibility and adventure of Job B.\n\n---\n\n#### **Part 2: Discovering Your Strategic Operating Model (SOM)**\n\n**Question 7: Your Relationship with Rules**\nWhen you start a new board game, what is your typical approach?\n*   **A) Inherited-Static:** I read the rules carefully and my primary goal is to play the game exactly as the creator intended.\n*   **B) Inherited-Dynamic:** I learn the basic rules, but I'm also looking for creative interpretations or \"house rules\" that might make the game more fun or interesting.\n*   **C) Derived-Static:** I often find the official rules are flawed, and I quickly come up with my own, \"better\" set of rules that I then insist everyone follows.\n*   **D) Derived-Dynamic:** I see the rules as just one possible system. I'm more interested in understanding the *underlying mechanics* of the game so I can find the optimal strategy, even if it means using the rules in an unconventional way.\n\n**Question 8: Your Response to a Failing System**\nYou are on a team project that is clearly failing due to a flawed process. What is your most likely first move?\n*   **A) Inherited-Static:** I keep following the process as best I can, because that's the established rule. The failure is not my responsibility.\n*   **B) Inherited-Dynamic:** I suggest a few practical \"patches\" or improvements to the existing process to try and get it back on track.\n*   **C) Derived-Static:** I declare the current process a total failure and propose a completely new, radical process that I believe is the only correct way forward.\n*   **D) Derived-Dynamic:** I start by gathering data to diagnose the precise root cause of the failure, and then propose a solution tailored to that specific problem, even if it means challenging the team's core assumptions.\n\n**Question 9: Your Source of Truth**\nWhen faced with a major life decision (e.g., a career change), where do you place the most trust?\n*   **A) Inherited-Static:** The time-tested wisdom and advice of my family, elders, and cultural traditions.\n*   **B) Inherited-Dynamic:** A blend of traditional wisdom and modern expert advice (e.g., what my parents say, balanced with what a career coach recommends).\n*   **C) Derived-Static:** My own, powerful intuition and a core set of personal principles that I have developed over time.\n*   **D) Derived-Dynamic:** A rigorous, first-principles analysis of the raw data, the potential outcomes, and which path best aligns with my constantly evolving values.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Interpret the Results**\n\n*   **Part 1 (Axiology):** Look at the pattern of A's and B's. This will create a \"fingerprint\" of your core values. For example, a string of B-B-B-B-B-B suggests a highly individualistic, principle-driven, ambitious, and risk-tolerant person. A string of A's suggests the opposite.\n*   **Part 2 (SOM):** Look at which letter (A, B, C, or D) appears most frequently. This reveals your dominant Strategic Operating Model. A strong pattern of \"D\" answers indicates a \"System Interrogator\" or Derived-Dynamic thinker."
