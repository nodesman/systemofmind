  "content": "can i say then that offering help is a risky affair in India except may be in a context like in airport or something else omre curated. \n\nYou told to not change my tendency to try and help (like I offered help with the guy talkign to NS) and it was good and i felt good. I am glad I did. And he did value it. I didn't do it with the expectation that he and I will become friends. I waited for him to hang up and then told him what happens and then he told me he should have asked me instead. I offered help after he hung up. Not that he sighed or anythng. \n\nI didnt know he would value it. He didn't explicitly say \"thank you\" or may be he did i don't remember. But he definitely apprecite it and I felt it. I had no regrets from that interaction. It was one off through. In an airport while standing in air india boarding pass queue. \n\n I don't remember ever helping someone at personal risk. I did spend one hour more in a office CASE task in the last job to find a solution for someoene even though the issue was not mine to fix. I asked aroudn foudn a fix and it helped them.  They got back ot me with a follow up of the fix. I tried to look into it for 1 hour and found no fix and told them to talk to X team as the right team to talk to and they did. I didn't get pulled into another endless task. I spent a short period of time and figure out it was not easy and put them back in the queue. In the professionl context I think i did the right amount of being helpful. In this situation I knew when to yield and ask them to go to the owning team. \n\nPerhaps that problem of me being overly helpful existed in my early adulthood. Very very early adulthood and that naivette wsa removed quickly. \n\nAnother worry was the abuse that happened in NOW when me taking what they considered to be crap work but I didn't mind or anything but the other thing is - he abused it and treated me very cruelly. I got him back really really good. \n\nI am now thinkign about my helping tendency as it stands today. To ensure it is in the right place. \n\nWhen we say we want to avoid parasites and castaways, those are in the context of a relational sense right? I mean that person who was in the airport he didn't ask for help it doesn't make him a parasite. I gave \"unsolicited\" help. Which was appreciated. Can there be a parasite in a solicited unsolicited onetime help situation? If I offer unsolicited help i don't remember ever looking for a thanks. I don't remeber expecting it. But i need your honest and balanced perspective of how to place the concept of parasitic and prites and castaways in teh context of one time vs. relational helps. \n"
