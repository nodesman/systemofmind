Do not ask me for any more input.\n\n1.  **List the Derived Sub-Questions:** Based on my current question, what are the logical, first-principles sub-questions that must be answered to arrive at a definitive conclusion?\n2.  **Answer Each Sub-Question:** Answer each sub-question in sequence, using only the logic, principles, and evidence established in our conversation history. For each point, cite specific concepts we have developed (e.g., \"Path 1/2/3,\" \"Reciprocity Gauge,\" \"Sovereign Architect,\" \"Instrumentalization,\" \"Ascribed Identity\") as evidence anchors for your reasoning.\n3.  **Synthesize a Final Answer:** Synthesize the answers into a final, coherent conclusion that directly addresses the core tension in my question: \"Should I in theory be open to all for my own well-being, or should my vetting be informed by social structure?\"\n4.  **The analysis must conclude with a clear, actionable, and psychologically sound strategy for all my future romantic prospecting.**"
