I HAVE a question: a father who has never taken the child to play outside or taken them somewhere to buy them something or gotten them gifts. not once. my mother reports not seeing once him playing or being kind to children or showing affection. if one has never felt affection or kindness but only negative experiences from the indivdual what is the fair balance in that? the lack of fondness and kindness - what is natural to happen in such a relationshp in general and what is the fair and natural consequence that such a aprent should be allowed to face
