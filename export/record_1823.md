Also answer this - supposedly the manager tried to silence me to make this IC comfortable because me asking questions was showing his incompetence and he took issue with it. the HR fired the manager, this person was given a warning it seems like the incompetence of toher people makes it that this guy is believed to be essential. but he is not staff engineer or any such level. he doesn't receive feedback but in some sense he learns but not from disciplined people but from failures and outcomes - he thorws shit at the wall. the code he writes looks like his disturbed mental mind that makes sense to him but in all fairness they somehow got some things done. what do you think?"
