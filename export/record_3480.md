Senior leadership and HR see the director as **accountable for the environment** that allowed the harassment to occur.\n\nTo save their job, the director must proactively:\n* **Acknowledge the Failure:** Publicly or within the team, they must own the failure of leadership.\n* **Partner with HR:** Actively work with HR to implement new training, communication protocols, and safer reporting channels.\n* **Rebuild Trust:** This is the hardest part. It requires immense personal effort to re-engage with the team, demonstrate empathy, and prove through consistent action that they are committed to a healthy work environment.\n* **Show Measurable Improvement:** After a year, the data (employee surveys, attrition rates) must show a significant positive change.\n\n---\n\n### B) Why \"Functioning As Is\" is a Failure\n\nChoosing to \"keep their nose clean and function as is\" is interpreted by leadership as a profound lack of understanding and ownership. It sends the message that the director believes the problem was just one \"bad apple\" and not a systemic issue they are responsible for.\n\nThis passivity is seen as:\n* **Negligence:** A failure to address the underlying cultural rot that led to the incident.\n* **A Lack of Leadership:** An inability to guide a team through a crisis.\n* **A Ticking Time Bomb:** Senior leadership will have zero confidence that the problem won't happen again under this director's watch.\n\nA director's job is not just to manage tasks but to cultivate a safe and productive environment. \"Functioning as is\" is an abdication of that core responsibility, making their eventual exit a certainty.\n```\n\nI am also considering alternative explanations like - the boss of donkey would have seen how other directors function right? looks like there was no delivery failure like failing to deliver a story or epic. Does quality failure explain it? I don't think so. I only see the above as the plausible outcome or did i derive what i wanted to tell myself to feel better? He has been working here for 5 years.. he delivered release fater release. not that he did it personally but he kept the nose clean. he oversaw a harassment and bullying case\n"
