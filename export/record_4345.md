Derive the 3-4 most critical, first-principles questions a \"Sovereign Architect\" must answer to vet a potential partner.\n2.  Answer each of these derived questions in detail, using only the logic, principles, and historical evidence from our conversation. Cite specific concepts we have developed (e.g., \"Path 1/2/3,\" \"instrumentalization,\" \"reciprocity gauge,\" \"sovereign\") as evidence anchors for your reasoning.\n3.  Synthesize these answers into a final, coherent, and actionable \"Sovereign Vetting Protocol.\" This protocol should provide a clear, universal framework for me to use when deciding whether or not to \"move forward\" with any woman I find attractive, anywhere in the world.\n4.  Do not ask me for any more input. This is a final synthesis based on the existing data."
