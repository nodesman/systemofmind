Given my history with this individual of him asking me to shut up and all the discriminatory remarks. Including me attempting to deescalate things by informally meeting him outside of work - what happened happened. How's this fair when I made every attempt to affect a positive outcome and yet we reached where we reached. 

Also I didn't reach out to him to resolve this because it was unpleasant to interact with him. Why do you expect me to interact with someone after they make jokes of colonialism (look back at what jokes he made early in the conversation) and then later asks me to shut up. Did the emotional impact that this toxic individual has had on me my liability? Should I overcome them? This one time he even said "faaak you" when I said I got my steamdeck which I let go because it was an exclamation of surprise and not a statement directed to hurt me. 

I expected professionalism. Did I fail by not "letting" go of his past behaviour and trying to resolve things one on one when those disagreements arose?

With all you know give me a  balanced and pragmatic answer to set me up to be a staff engineer. There are pragmatic truths about working as a staff engineer. Keep that in mind while making a assessment and giving me an advice
