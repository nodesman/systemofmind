I felt uncomfortable. After having lived in the zeitgeist of sexual oppression, I think it may have been that, I don't know. But there were problems with feeling comfortable having sex in the environment, in the environment meaning am I very acutely impacted by the environment, potentially. But the association even, look, I am literally able to be intimate with any nationality other than me. Any, any, that's another thing I found out.\n"
