Did I underestimate the kind of decision I was making dynamic based on information and underestimate the changes - how will I die - who will be my family - but my parents have many siblings and mine is both derelict and harmful. Based on that I can say it is good to be dynamic to decide to abandon India. In that sense this compromise of wanting to spend the rest of my days slowly taking care of parents is a good idea. \n\nI had a massive change when I naturalised here right? The whole let down effect? - was that a moment of great change becuase new questions came up? One is definitely the sudden loss of the america thing. \n\nWhich means now I have to have friends - people who care about me. If not it would have been a circle of who? My friends at work? School? If I had stayed in India? It looks like it was already a trajectory towards some isolation. Not the kind of life my parents were goign to live but I could stay in touch with cousins. \n\nSo in the world of LLMs we suddenly ask how does it change agile, how does it change CI how does it change how we store data? A fundamental revisiting of questions? Of roles, jobs and functions? \n\nWhat is the scope of my derived dynamic - is it just where I chose to live and was it a big one is that why I am in this pain? Do you see any inherited dynamics in my life? The reason I ask is - we discussed that it is cognitively demanding which means new massively new number of answers had to be derived. \n\nIt seems to be the only viable strategy of the times?\n"
