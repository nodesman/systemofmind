So it is a prisoner's dilemma, right, in India, like you are, you are, you're violating the sanctity of a girl by stepping out of line, isn't that what it is when you try to violate the system by trying to get into a so-called love marriage, isn't that what you're doing? Isn't that why it is heavily discouraged, why it's looked down upon to show interest in a girl?\n\nIf so, in this new context as it makes sense with that level of clarity to show interest in women without worry, there is some level of fear right in here here too. It's not like it's morally morally discouraged, but it's OK, right? It's somewhat OK in the West.\n"
