Given that we have this parental framework what have the discussed or covered or considered that requires labeling that is not covered in the parental framework that we have gone through that is not in the universal framework that is worth. not something flimsy but it should be a significant label in a relationship. it can also be nothing if everything is either in teh parental framework or universal framework. i also don't want variables that track my own father's behavior and the things i've gone into in particular as variables to add to af ramework. this is meant to be generic parental and universal frameworks
