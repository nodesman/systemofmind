I wonder if I made a set of derived decisions that have become set in stone in time that cannot be gone back on. \n\ndid that door close on comparing myself to the inherited dynamic of american fomo close the moment i chose to stay here in netherlands?\n\nsure i can go onward to the usa with great loss but it will be at a great loss. where does time fall into that framework of moving from the derived dynamic of my pragmatic choice of netherlands to trying to get back on the totem pole of the usa life? where does the lack of pragmtism of getting on the green card treadmill at age 38 in 2025 of all times even fall in the decision to overcome the inherited dynamic of the usa life. strangely there are other inherited dynamics like being a upsc government employee that never appealed to me. \n\ndoes it seem like i am operating on two modes simultaneously is that why the pain is. or may be i have not chosen to bring in personal pride into the achievemnet of my derived dynamic system. i could have gone back and said i will marry someone else but i ws kept from doing so becuase i felt that i had better options while here. which is true. okay i am healed now - why not go marry an indian girl becuase it is just painful.. if the only way forward was to marry indian women i would have done it. like literally no one else will marry or rather there are no women in the world other than indian women - but i have a choice now. i cannot only do better than indian women now. even in the worst case. \n\ni chose to stay here, i could have at somep oint tried to get a H1-b and moved there but i felt this was a better life -\n\nwhat abotu my american accent influence and the very wide americanism impact from working in tech, that i am ingesting online in tech and otherwise? Where does that fall?\n\nmy question still remains if \n\ni decided to stay in india to see how thing went and after a while i felt it didnt work out so i chose to leave after collecting data - so that is an evidence of dynamic based on undertanding the state ofe things. what was dynamic and derived i do not know. the reality of my life is much better but the pull of american inherietd dynamic was high. there may be other parts that need to be resolved as well - things like.. my own idealism of the kidn of environment i wanted to live in? \n\n"
