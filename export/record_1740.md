One other thing - does this guy not know this kind of behavior is unethical and crass? I mean - It almost fits a stereotype that people talk about as a bad manager? But that could just be me but do you agree with this wording - but you need not? Why would you taunt a collauge let alone a report? Did this person think the veneer of decency was charitable and this is what they will get if pushed? He says he has worked for 27 years. What do you think? In this profession everyone does their best to step up and do the best? Did this person think this was good management? Every organization has anti-bullying, anti retaliation trainings does this guy just glaze over it? what is the deal?
