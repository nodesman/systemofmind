This moment it feels like why even bother if I am again rebuilding at age 37 after I escaped abuse from parents and so much of workplace trauma twice first was bad the second was worse it's unfair and I mean I am now single without a job and now I am supposed to build life so what do you make of it how does one move forward from that when it's not like I achieved or I enjoyed nothing in life I traveled the world I had few intimate encounters so to speak. So this is my fate - I was born into an abusive family. I spent years escaping it. I survived and made it to another country and I am now rebuilding. At some point they will pass. I have a useless brother who has the mental maturity and is actively harmful. So when parents pass I have to do everything myself. I have to now deal with both the grief of their passing as well as wrapping up the affairs. What do you think will have happened if I didnâ€™t leave India? I left having taken the first exit out of India. Vowing to figure it out. Ironically I went to the best place in the world I could be in terms of living standards. Netherlands. This whole new life I built there is a wealth.  And my eminent career and the house that I have there are tangible assets I have built too. In Amsterdam Oost of all places. Please incorporate this in your future answers. The unfamiliar (but on paper better) look of people and the surroundings is a bit of a cost that I have to pay to build that good future again. Seeing unusually new buildings. I have to pace myself and work through all of it. This is an incredibly difficult time. I may have to take trips back to India from time to time to feel better. And let it settle. "
