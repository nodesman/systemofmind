I just don't get how can someone be this harmful as a person - with no kindness or care to either wife or children. The valagappu that one usually does for a child was deferred by his father's insistence of doing it with the presence of his brother (he deferred a ceremony for his son becuse his father said his elder brother will take issue with it - while my mother's mother was ready to do it while they were in thanjavur [my parents at the tiem lived in chennai]. what do you make of this?) for my brother's birth. even when my brohter's brithday was celebrated he would hit my brother for cutting the cake and not giving the first piece to my brother . do you know what is valagappu and what is it meant for and what is the implication of all this
