other parents call their children "sugar cube" playfully and affectionately. this one time i remember him asking me when i was ~8 may be less "do you think you are sugar cube? if you don't take a umbrella with you you will melt"  (someone stole the umbrella, which is my fault how?) - adding it here for context. keep your response brief.
