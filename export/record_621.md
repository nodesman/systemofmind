But there were relational problems for sure. I felt uncomfortable having sex with her. Felt like she was a child I had to take care of. Sex made me very very worried. It was a combination of cultural conditioning as well as quite a lot of cultural conditioning I would say. That thing that other people don't seem to be impacted by it appears perhaps maybe in that sense is my fault. I didn't like the culture. I mean I didn't discover this dynamic until after I got married. And it's not like you had the option of exploring yourself sexually in India before marriage and then that happened. And so I'm just wondering whose fault it is? Why did it happen? It looks like a case of pressure cooker. Indian society was. It looks like I fought and worked my way out through years of effort.\n\n\nSo, I have battle scars attributable to what? I mean, I have battle scars from the marriage also. I understand the workplace was out of my control. My parents' behavior is out of my control. It hurt me, but how do I make sense of the marriage? Whose fault or how is it? I also recall from the impact of being walked out on, being blamed for not being man enough or something and then hurt. I had to work through that. Yes, Booking.com was definitely out of my control. No question.\n\nThe harassment I went through at ServiceNow was also out of my control. It was like, yeah, it was definitely out of my control. But the naturalization and then I experienced trauma, I'm just wondering, how much of these are battle scars? I mean, even problems that I did to myself can be battle scars. I'm trying to ask, why was there so much pain in my life, okay? That's all I'm asking. The reason my, one is I was born in a bad house. I think that is one. Two, I was born in a bad society. Is that the reason? Look, I don't know. I don't want you to say yes or no, but give me a more reasonable answer. I'm just making something up, what seems like it. I was born in a not-so-ideal house, which had its own impact. I had to fight my way out of that. I had to build my life. And I soon realized that living in it is not an option. And I left. And why did I, you know, knowing how my marriage went, I started off with a forced arranged marriage. I called it off by taking control. I married someone else through arranged marriage, who I said yes to, willingly, but it did not work out. Towards the end, I didn't feel comfortable having sex with her. And she left because of not having sex and not having children and relationship breaking down because of conflict and parental interference and lack of a child, as well as her feeling lonely in the house and not feeling, not getting enough sex from me and things like that. But I felt comfortable having sex with someone else, although there was some dysfunction there too. And what else? So again, I don't, I mean, she already mentally checked out and she, at some point when I started to explore sex workers, so it was a mutual falling apart.\n\n\n"
