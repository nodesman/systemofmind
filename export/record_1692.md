See, what I don't also understand, there was not a modicum of trying to be a good manager. Is this any of this taunting, making remarks about people's nationality, are these things signs of a good manager, a decent manager, basic professionalism? I don't see evidence of that. How did this guy spend so long as a manager? I don't understand. You know, when you do some job, you would try to be your best, right? You would try to do, achieve some level of, you know, do things well, to the best of ability you can, but what does, do you think he was trying to do his best by doing these things? You work in a big company you have to bring your best. Does it seem like he did that?
