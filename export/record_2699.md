  "content": "I don't know if it was related but this manager was praising this IC in stand up for closing customer support tickets right away and then immediately buffalo manager started priasing him that toxic ic got it closed even before he could get to them. i asked toxic ic if he waited for a resonse before closing and he said no. apparently that undercut the praise - buffalo manager came to office and said thanks for calling it out because then 'i would have been accused of favoritism' or something..  meaning that interaction happened on zoom while the interaction between the manager and me happened in person where he caem from his home in the hague to hte office. the stand up was at 10 and he was at the office at around 11:30 or 12 so it seems odd to me. i mean.. i dont know why he came to office. a part of me wonders if he lost face and came to office to ahve that interaction with me to have me soothe his ego or something.
