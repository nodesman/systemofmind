The default stance with strangers\n\nStart neutral but alert.\n\t•\tDon’t assume “everyone is good” (naïve), and don’t assume “everyone is a threat” (paranoid).\n\t•\tA useful middle stance is “I don’t know you yet, so I’ll give you small amounts of trust in low-stakes areas, and expand or contract that based on what you show me.”\n\nThink of it like lending—not giving—trust.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Using evidence\n\nYou’re right: ignoring evidence (especially repeated behavior) sets you up for harm.\n\t•\tPatterns matter more than one-offs. A single careless remark might mean nothing; a consistent disregard for others is a reliable signal.\n\t•\tWeight evidence by context. A lie about something trivial may not matter; a lie about safety, loyalty, or money matters much more.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Small signals vs. red flags\n\t•\tSmall signals (forgetfulness, awkwardness, ignorance) → note them, but don’t over-interpret.\n\t•\tRed flags (coercion, cruelty, consistent dishonesty, refusal to take responsibility) → take seriously, even if they look small at first. They scale into danger.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Preventing one person from warping your view\n\nWhat your former manager did was extreme. It’s natural that it leaves you jumpy.\nThe way to stop it from coloring everyone else is to distinguish between the outlier and the baseline:\n\t•\tOutlier: “Buffalo was willing to weaponize fear at work.”\n\t•\tBaseline: “Most people are not like that, but I will remain alert to the signs of anyone heading that way.”\n\nThis helps you avoid projecting Buffalo onto strangers in the street.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Balancing protection with openness\n\nHere’s a useful principle: “Trust, but test.”\n\t•\tYou don’t have to extend blind trust.\n\t•\tBut you also don’t need to wall yourself off.\n\t•\tGive small tests (e.g., share something minor and see if it’s respected). Expand or retreat accordingly.\n\n⸻\n\n6. Detecting change in people\n\nPeople can change, but not often in core traits.\n\t•\tLook for sustained new patterns over time. A single good act doesn’t erase 10 years of selfishness.\n\t•\tIf you keep waiting for a reversal against long evidence (like with your brother), you’re choosing hope over reality. That choice has costs.\n\n⸻\n\n7. Family and resistance\n\nIt’s common to resist forming a harsh mental model of family, because it threatens your identity and sense of belonging. But facts are facts:\n\t•\tTen years of evidence outweighs wishful thinking.\n\t•\tAccepting the model doesn’t mean you hate him; it means you act with eyes open.\n\n⸻\n\n8. Institutions vs. individuals\n\nYes, law and institutions exist to limit chaos. But they are slow, sometimes inadequate, and often only step in after damage is done.\nSo your personal discernment is still essential: boundaries, evidence, pattern recognition.\n\n⸻\n\n9. Practical framework\n\nHere’s one you can actually use:\n\t1.\tNeutral start: Don’t assume good or bad.\n\t2.\tLow-stakes tests: Share a small responsibility or vulnerability.\n\t3.\tObserve patterns: Are they consistent over time?\n\t4.\tLook for red flags: Dishonesty, cruelty, coercion → don’t ignore.\n\t5.\tAdjust model: Expand trust if they show care, shrink if they show harm.\n\t6.\tReview occasionally: Be willing to update if their pattern shifts—up or down.\n\nThis keeps you flexible but not exposed.\n\n⸻\n\n👉 So yes, Raj—you should form mental models of people. It’s not unfair; it’s simply reality-based. But you don’t need to live in fear. The trick is progressive trust and constant updating: you start neutral, you collect evidence, and you revise your model as you go.\n\n⸻\n\nDo you want me to show you how this could apply step by step to your brother (a long-standing case), and separately to strangers in public (where your fear spikes)? That would make the framework less abstract.\n```\n\nTalk about my brother and derive his consistent pattern if any\n"
