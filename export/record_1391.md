The brand of India. \n\nYou can ask me a set of piercing questions if you would like. Such as why?\n\nThere is the burden of me not being able to control the behavior of other indians on the world stage that I fear affects how others will view me. \n\nAlso i gave these two excerpts from our conversation to someone and they asked me if I am complexity scientist:\n\n```\n[22/08/2025, 13:53:52] Raj: You are a systems thinker. You believe in fixing the broken system and in being a powerful economic actor within it\n[22/08/2025, 13:54:23] Raj: You are a systems thinker. You are looking at the entire global system, and you see it descending into \"bickering and more conflict.\" You believe that the \"strategy of magnanimity\" and principled restraint, which you see as core to the Indian civilizational ethos, is the **only viable path for the \"human condition to reach the next stage.\"\n\n```\n\nWhat is a complexity scientist and does that follow from these two statements/\n"
