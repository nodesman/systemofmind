In that i hhad written things ike 'Perhaps some feel leveraged having batted for him in the past, but travis kalanick at uber found out the hard way' - would this have reached HR-B? Or just investigator - would that was the last line in a a 10 point feedback. would they have been that thorough to read all that? I even said he did somethings better than me - about the toxic IC. But I wish his work was not obstructive to me. And that he lies a lot. "
