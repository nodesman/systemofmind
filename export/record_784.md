Aske me questirons to decide where I am on these two questions
```

I asked you this question in the context of comparing tech life to RBI life.  which means i wantedan answer to where I fell in those two questions. But your questions to determine that seem to ask about my current life but those seem like intentinoal questions about what one values in general 
Did you get the kind of answer you were looking for in my answers? If not should we try again?
