And then there's a whole pressure to perform. And we say having sex is a fundamental need, and it is so badly looked on upon in India. And then you are here, how can you not have sex, like do people have sex here? Anyway, a question I'm trying to make, I think is, other than through pornography and, you know, self-release, how does one get relief on one's terms, does everyone have sexual relationships, relationships that are only sexual?is it such a norm in netherln ds? \n"
