You’re describing a shift in where “reality” is mediated for us: from newspapers and family traditions (the older “real world” you mention) to the internet, and in particular the Anglophone internet. That is a sharp observation, and not at all trivial.\n\nA few things stand out in what you’re saying:\n\t1.\tTransmission of culture\n\t•\tBefore, culture was largely handed down: family, elders, neighbors, colleagues. You observed how your brother followed a cousin—a model path shaped by lived examples. That’s a culture with continuity.\n\t•\tNow, much of what is learned is absorbed through the internet—forums, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter. The “elders” are algorithmic feeds, strangers with viral reach, or communities you stumble into. That’s a culture with discontinuity.\n\t2.\tShift in arbiters of truth\n\t•\tNewspapers and broadcasters had filtering power. As you note, they were entwined with state and elite interests. Their curated reality was slow-moving but stable.\n\t•\tSocial media blows that open: now “raw” video evidence, personal testimony, and leaks can circulate outside official filters. But that doesn’t make it pure truth—it makes reality contested and fragmented. Everyone is their own publisher, but the platforms (Twitter/X, YouTube, TikTok) now act as the new arbiters, only algorithmically rather than editorially.\n\t3.\tAnglophone dominance\n\t•\tYou’ve correctly pointed out that for many of us—even those not in the U.S. or U.K.—the Anglophone internet is “where reality is.” The lingua franca of the digital world is English.\n\t•\tThat means you and I are daily immersed not just in global news but also in American and British cultural battles—race, gender politics, gun control, free speech debates. Even if they aren’t directly relevant in the Netherlands or India, they bleed into our own frameworks.\n\t4.\tThe risk for non-Anglophone cultures\n\t•\tYour question about the “Tamil internet” is on point. Can Tamil, Hindi, or Dutch online cultures grow without being swamped? Possibly, but there’s a gravitational pull: if you want reach, attention, or influence, you default to English.\n\t•\tThe risk isn’t that local cultures vanish outright, but that they survive in narrower niches while the “main stage” is Anglophone.\n\nSo, yes, what you’re seeing is the replacement of inherited, local, slower-moving cultures by a global, Anglophone, fast-moving digital culture. This isn’t obvious to everyone because it happens gradually, and because most people mistake their internet feeds for a neutral “window onto reality.” What you’re doing is noticing the architecture of it.\n\nA last thought: this isn’t just about the Anglophone internet defining reality—it’s about how algorithmically curated attention defines it. The risk is not just being exposed to American/British issues, but being conditioned to perceive those issues as primary—even when your lived environment tells a different story.\n\nWould you like me to sketch out how this plays forward—say, what the next 20–30 years of this Anglophone digital dominance could look like? That seems like the natural continuation of your line of thought.\n\n```\n\nGiven this what do you think is hte implication on our discussion thus far?\n"
