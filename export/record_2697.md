'When people at work make you responsible for their feelings and comfort, it often looks like emotional outsourcing — they shift the burden of their internal state onto you. This can manifest in subtle or overt ways. For example, they might expect you to always adjust your communication to avoid their discomfort; if you give constructive feedback, they accuse you of being too harsh, focusing on how your words made them feel rather than the actual content. They may interpret your boundaries as personal rejection; if you say, “I can’t help with that right now,” they respond with, “Why are you being cold?” or “I thought we were a team,” treating your limit-setting as emotional injury. They might avoid direct conflict but still hold you accountable for their reactions — for instance, not speaking up in meetings but later saying, “You made me feel excluded,” as if you were supposed to anticipate their unspoken needs. Another pattern is shifting blame for their reactions or poor performance onto you, like saying, “I couldn’t focus because your email stressed me out,” or “I didn’t speak up because you looked annoyed,” as though your behavior caused their outcomes. They may also want a say in how you express emotions, telling you, “You seemed annoyed. That made me feel anxious,” expecting you to modulate your natural expressions to maintain their comfort. Often, they pressure you to smooth things over after tense interactions, even if you’ve done nothing wrong, with the emotional labor falling on your side. Finally, they may guilt you for not participating in emotional caretaking, such as saying, “You didn’t ask how I felt after that meeting,” or “You didn’t back me up — that really hurt,” expecting you to constantly monitor and manage their emotional state. The common thread is they treat your normal, professional behavior — especially asserting boundaries, giving feedback, or not managing their emotions — as something you should fix or avoid. If this happens frequently, it reflects blurry emotional boundaries. You’re not obligated to regulate others’ feelings — only to act respectfully and communicate clearly. Their emotions are their responsibility."
