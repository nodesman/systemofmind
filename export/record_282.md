When he came to amsterdam in 2022 I told him about abusive upbringing and the bad things that the bastard father did and to that he says 1) “I’ve seen many bad things probably worse than you” 2) there are many ways to raise a child (minimising normalising my father’s behavior). I guess my question is what is your balanced perspective on his involvement always being preceded by my father’s involvement or being triggered by my father. This may be a pattern that is accidental in my perception but orthogonally emergent from some other issue in this system. I am not saying my father is avoiding me. I am saying when I reach out to my brother and communicate the same issue or show indications of that problem like talking about my father he doesn’t seem to register my distress. My father too is not ‘avoiding’ me. I am trying to say his involved and serious actions are prompted not by my communicating or mentioning it but from intense behaviors directed at my father or himself doing it. Whats funny too is my father apparently called and told my bother after I beat him up. I don’t know what the content of the call was but why reach out to him - a sympathetic ear? for once my brohter did not call and yell and lambast me. "
