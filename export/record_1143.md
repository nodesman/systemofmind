Not because towers aren’t built, but because car demand keeps rising while neither city is seriously restraining car use or pricing road space. New bridges/roads will mostly fill up.\n\nWhy I’m confident (and not hedging):\n\t•\tObserved trend is already bad and worsening. TomTom’s 2024 data shows peak-hour travel times rose to ~29.3 min/10 km in Mumbai and ~~30 min/10 km in Chennai; Mumbai’s global rank slipped to 39 despite big projects coming online. That’s fresh, measured data—no models.  ￼ ￼ ￼\n\t•\tRoad building doesn’t cure congestion. Decades of evidence on induced demand: add capacity → you induce roughly proportional driving, erasing speed gains. Multiple government reviews and meta-analyses conclude this, not just opinion pieces.  ￼ ￼ ￼\n\t•\tNeither city prices peak driving. With no congestion charge, weak/patchy parking pricing, and high political reluctance to curb ownership, demand stays unchecked; capacity increases get swallowed. (You can also read this as the Downs–Thomson dynamic: car speeds gravitate to the quality of the next-best mode unless you manage demand.)  ￼\n\nWhat would actually flip this forecast (and I mean actually):\n\t1.\tPrice the peaks (cordon/area pricing or equivalent) and enforce it.\n\t2.\tCitywide parking reform (market-rate, limited supply, real enforcement).\n\t3.\tMake non-car modes faster than driving door-to-door (bus lanes that stay bus lanes, reliable metros, interchanges that don’t punish transfers).\nIf those three arrive together, congestion can ease even as population grows; without them, it won’t—with or without high-rises. The recent numbers already point that way.  ￼\n\nSo, if we’re being honest: yes—on the current track, car hell is effectively guaranteed. Only a deliberate shift to demand management and transit priority changes the outcome.\n```\n\nThen .. if we assume the opportunities are for high ereducatino gbecome harder.. then.. not only is my own llife in idnia likey to get harder in metropolitans but ...my chidlrens?\n"
