It's May 30th, about 5-6 days after the last conversation. I went to the grocery store and they asked me, are you from this town? Unprompted, after I bought some things. This is more data point. Another hotel I went to asked me, that person started talking to me in Hindi. Again, unprompted. I had to tell them, I am actually Tamil.
