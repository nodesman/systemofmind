I need you to think about this:

I reported both the manager having made a discriminatory remark about “not doing anything at the workplace that would have people mistake me for being macho like in indian and brazilian cultures” (this happened 8 months before the incident)

i reported this other IC too for making jokes about british colonised india because tea was good - and things like that. this happened nearly 3 years before the incident

one may be tempted to ask why did i bring this up to hr 

Why does it seem to you like i reported it
