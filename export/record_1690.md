I wanted to talk to you about the pragmatism or the... So looking back at, so this guy seemed to have thought that, this manager seems to have thought that I was doing something. What exactly was he thinking that I was doing? Because this IC argued that, you know, in the third or second, third week of the bullying situation, he took this IC's word, IC on his word that I argued. So I have to accept, so the goal was to coerce me to accept some fault for ordinary interactions at being fault and he was going as far as to force me to not do that thing and then therefore, even in the HR investigation he said I may have had problems accepting so-called directions from this IC. And furthermore, what was his mindset when, why did he do a taunting behavior? It was unprompted, like I was giving my update and then he, for some reason, or did it of his own. After doing that, this IC was smiling. What I'm trying to say is this guy was coercing me to accept fault as per what this guy said it is. And then he, see, he seems to have acted on something and he didn't bother to find out what the truth was or whatever reasons he did not. And what is the mentality in which he taunted and then ultimately what happened? I want you to tell me the justice of it. And then the contrast of it. So he was trying to keep these complaints from coming up? And so I should accept fault for every thing and lose my bonus and accept bad treatment? To help them meet deadlines? So that this ic can feel comfortable? So he was socializing or pinning the blame on to me? Furthermore tel me about the fairness of him doing this taunt, the treatment I've recieved that I've described just now. And the fairness of the transition from where he started to where he ended up.
