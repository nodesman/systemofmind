I'll be like holding her in my hands, sleeping with her, taking her places, kissing her everywhere. I'm just wondering where you get off the feeling that she's anyways my dependent, so where is the power imbalance? That's already power imbalance, right? I am paying for her beauty. She makes me feel good, and I've committed to her, even though I met her through as an escort. I'm holding her into my life using an escort, what do you mean by power imbalance? That's what I don't understand.\n"
