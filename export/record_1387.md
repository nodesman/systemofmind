A traditional view of duty would say your place is in India, fighting in the trenches. A modern, diaspora view says you can contribute from anywhere.\n>\n> **Now that you are a sovereign Dutch citizen, free from the immediate \"survival\" battle, does your duty feel more like that of a **\"Soldier\"** who must one day return to the fight on the ground, or like that of a **\"Diplomat\"** whose job is to build bridges, channel resources, and represent the best of his civilization in a foreign land?\n\nWe are breaking new ground here because I not thought this though which is why I am asking. I am only now understanding my own motivation for why I care about contributing from the trenches. But contributing from the trenches is not feasible at the moment. So what does that mean in a real world sense? My care about making a better world by making India succeed in a small way is kaput? Do I love the indian society itself? Or just a more magnanimous society in the world? Yes. I don’t like Indian society of its own. I don’t like all the major flaws of Hinduism or any other religion which exists in South Asia. Not christianity, not catholicism, not islam. I respect Tamil culture I guess. \n\nYour question assumes I have reconciled the need to contribute to a better future and my current state of things but I have not. It in fact even seems stupid to even care about building a better collective future. Who even thinks about that in the world? No one seems to not head of state. Does that mean I have to now accept the practicality of being in the trenches with my long term well being. You have to put your oxygen mask on before you helping others right? In that sense this is already done for? Within that scope one must let go of that interest and try to make an impact in other ways? May be a transnational way? And not about making the nation state succeed. Am I even as a single individual the right person to be able to make that impact - I work as an engineer and therefore the nation succeeds? And therefore the world is a better place? In a country with a billion people? You can call me out on the absurdity politely if you want. \n\n**Question 2: On the Scale of Your \"Impact\"**\n\n> Your ambition is to see India become a powerful and positive force in the world. As we've discussed, this can be achieved through \"macro\" actions (politics, building a billion-dollar company) or \"micro\" actions (mentoring, creating a website).\n>\n> **Given the immense personal cost of the \"macro\" path (sacrificing your well-being), is it possible that the most strategic and impactful contribution a person like you can make is to live a single, deeply examined, and well-lived life, and then to share the wisdom of that life with a few others? In other words, could the \"micro\" path of being a mentor and a creator be a more powerful and realistic form of nation-building than the \"macro\" path of becoming a politician?**\n\nYes! It makes sense to me that a deeply examined life and sharing that wisdom with a few ohters is good. If I publish myself and a lot of people read that book yes I guess. In a messy democracy like India it is probably super difficult to do things to benefit them without suspending democracy. But of its own being a politician with power allows you to do things at a far higher scale right? Combinerd with the answer to the previous question. May be taking a view of contributing to a nano contribution of a country in the trenches is that not an absurd way to approach this? You can call me out on it.. Also does this answer adequately answer the question you asked? \n\n\n**Question 3: On Reconciling the \"Ideal\" with the \"Real\"**\n\n> You believe in the \"ideal\" of India as a moral, altruistic power. You have also personally experienced the \"real\" India—the trauma, the chaos, the systemic failures.\n>\n> **How do you plan to hold both of these truths at the same time, going forward? Will your work (e.g., your \"Chola Empire\" website) be a purely celebratory project that focuses only on the ideal? Or will it be a more complex project that honestly grapples with both the glory and the darkness of the civilization? Which approach feels more authentic to the man you have become?**\n\nLet’s not assume I AM goign to do it. But if it did it would be a celebration and propagation of the good parts - an ideal. Not together a forum for discussing and solving the bad ones. I am not even sure if I want to propagate the chola name anymore. It is someone else’s legacy. \n\n**Question 4: On Your \"Progeny\" and Their Role**\n\n> You want your children to be the next link in a powerful lineage.\n>\n> **What is the single most important lesson or value, forged from your entire life's journey, that you would want to pass on to your Tamil-Dutch children to ensure they become a \"positive force\" in the world, in the way you envision? Is it the value of ambition? Resilience? Integrity? Compassion? Or something else entirely?**\n\nMake the world a better place than you found it. Make bad people pay. Reward good behavior. Be good. Fight when it makes sense to do so. Deter bad behavior. Make sustainable change. \n"
