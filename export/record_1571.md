So all things considered - what is the balanced perspective on this negotiation vicotry? I was not trying to exend the negotiation further. I was already distraut enough that I cried before the day i sent my asking offer. I was spent and the offer was enough to not feel irritating. Give me an answer taking into account my having done multiple rounds
