  "content": "the demand for reciprocity is not a boundary.. or is it.. how do i thin of it - how did indian society fail in that? \n\nWe are also very extensively meandered about Indian society and the Tamil Nadu society. I know for a fact that the judicial system doesn't work, which means they are parasiting. Does the executive work, the bureaucracy also doesn't work. The only system that sort of works is the legislative. Sort of, yeah, mostly they do their work at the central level. The state level bureaucracy hardly does their work. State level, again, the judges hardly do their work. They're not delivering justice, they are assholes. So in the reciprocity sense, where am I? The roads are bad, and on the road, every man for himself, the lack of cleanliness, the cultural awfulness, all of this is what? If I were to fit it in my value system, what is that in my value system? What has broken down in my deal with that India? The caste system that seems to pervade everything, arranged marriage is basically a propagation of caste. The whole horoscope system is a propagation of what? What exactly?\n\nAnd, I mean, in some ways, at least the Muslims will keep within their area. The Hindus, the moment they identify with you, they are like trying to enter your area. And then the Hindus, you have to keep some distance from them. They try to tell you what to do.\n"
