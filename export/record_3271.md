It becomes part of your mental conditioning—just like the status games in system A.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy it’s powerful\n\nHumans are associative learners. Every tolerated act of disrespect is not just an external event; it’s an internalized data point shaping self-concept.\n\t•\tIf repeated enough, you start predicting disrespect in future encounters.\n\t•\tYou may preemptively lower yourself to “avoid conflict.”\n\t•\tThis further normalizes the premise: my place is beneath.\n\n⸻\n\nThe flip side\n\nThe moment you refuse disrespect—by boundary-setting, withdrawal, or confrontation—you inject a new premise: I don’t deserve this.\n\t•\tThe first few refusals feel alien and risky.\n\t•\tBut each repetition rewires the loop in the opposite direction.\n\n\n```\n\nWhat do you think of this passage?\n"
