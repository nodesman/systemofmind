there are two possibilities one is HR knew the complicity of the director as well as well as other possibilities he didn't know one way or the other the director was the one dealing with HR in this whole affair because I complained against that manager as well so I'm just trying to say ask you what how HR saw this situation in these two outcome two possibilities and furthermore one other question I have is if this manager given what we know about all he has done did not think he can be a part of he can be a subject of HR report given his all this all that he did including the taunting. Given the possibility of director involvement do you think they paid three manager a lot to leave as an unfortunate but necessary casualty to manage their liability in the face of me requesting the investigation report in writing from my lawyer or they surely found him at fault directly and threw the book at him. I'm leading the question. Can you be balanced
