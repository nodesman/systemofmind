What was the purpose of actually throwing the performance? If the things he did were orally and on writing? To be clear - it does not seem like the PIP thing was a direct outcome of the performance review and it takes 1 year to get there - meaning - i lost the bonus. which i only learnt in august but the whole "most likely PIP" thing happened in June (which date?) so what was the point?
