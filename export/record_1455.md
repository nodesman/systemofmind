Or that I am in Netherlands? \n\nIf I get a job now in Netherlands, quite likely that europeans have a bias towards remote work too. \n\nI am more than happy to work in the office. But a good number of positions seem to be remote work. And that seems like will be hte case forever. \n\nI am going to be in the netherlands and I am stuck in the software engineering profession forever right? or to a FIRE situation and me being financially independent. Which menas again.. not much transit other than my own induced one. \n\nWhich means.. one has to budget for motion more and more. in terms of time and planned movement. in some moments goign to rotterdam and seeing the similar thing can feel boring. but we already discussed the alternatives aren't great.. its either suburban hell or fortress hell\n"
