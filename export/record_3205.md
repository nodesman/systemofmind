For example:\n    *   If you're angry at their injustice, they label you as \"angry\" or \"negative.\"\n    *   If you're sensitive to their cruelty, they label you as \"oversensitive.\"\n    *   If you challenge their narrative, they label you as \"difficult\" or \"argumentative.\"\n*   By successfully labeling you, they can dismiss anything you say as a product of your supposed flaw, rather than a valid response to their harmful behavior. Your brother's comment, \"When you say things, people experience it very negatively and angrily,\" is a perfect example of this.\n\n\n``` \n\nbuffalo walked away thinking what?\n"
