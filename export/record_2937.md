For failing to support me and orchestrating what he did and makign discriminatory remarks, and retaliating on record against me for the sick leave. it looks like donkey knew about it and somehow turned a blind eye. he was onrecord dismissing my request for help. he was fired for legal reasons - he signed an MTA in return for a face saving exit and transitioning without causing problems - the HR person wanted him fired for sure. so i am just wondering what was done in terms of how he was fired. what were the terms of firing? this is a firing by other means through an MTA. clearly or do you disagree with this premise that the HR person had enough to make him sign on the dotted line. keep in mind you can have paid him 100k but he was still uprooting his life and leaving a country with no other job on hand and pulling his children out of school and losing the visa etc. so really what is the most likely circumstances of exit? incentivized? or otherwise?"
