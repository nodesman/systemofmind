I am asking this to understand 1) where I went wrong 2) what I can pragmatically change about myself to avoid this in the future.

In this situation I am being criticised for "overstepping" (if you agree?) 

But others criticise indians for being overly subassertive. Or not speaking up. In any case what is the cultural expectation in Netherlands ?
