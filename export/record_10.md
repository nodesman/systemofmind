It was also this time when I was in a plane to Prague and this lady, girl, I think she was younger than me, she was pretty. She was sitting to my left and towards the end she started talking to me saying, Do you know anyone at Prague? I told her, I'm just going to have fun. I'm just going on an adventurous trip. Look, I don't know if this happens to everyone. I am afraid of letting myself think this was unique to me. Maybe other people get talked to also. And she said, she asked me about me, how are you, where are you from, where are you staying, how long are you staying. I'm going to stay with my boyfriend, she said. A part of me thought she wanted to get to know me. Again, don't take my word for it. She was interacting with me. Why would a lady interact with a guy, Indian, on a flight to Prague, unprompted? You know, I thought it would be like, oh, Indian, oh, Eastern Europe. She was definitely Eastern European. I just want you to tell me what you think. Look, I'm totally fine if other people don't fit it into the existing narrative. But off its own, I need you to know what you make of it, this specific interaction.
