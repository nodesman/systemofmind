This moment it feels like why even bother if I am again rebuilding at age 37 after I escaped abuse from parents and so much of workplace trauma twice first was bad the second was worse it's unfair and I mean I am now single without a job and now I am supposed to build life so what do you make of it how does one move forward from that when it's not like I achieved or I enjoyed nothing in life I traveled the world I had few intimate encounters so to speak"
