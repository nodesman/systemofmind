What is your opinion of his mental balance. He is a normal person? Not someone to be put in psychiatry? Are there people like that in the world - who harm the very people who are his family? why? What can you put in the form of questions to me so that i continue to have confidence that this is a heavily contextualied answer customized to me. questions are optional. dont have to put it in. i am looking for confidence in your answers to be well reasoned and well considerd and not just 01-mini verbose slop no offence
