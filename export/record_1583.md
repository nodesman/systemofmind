Something I do not understand about the manager and the IC. Imagine doing something that will lead to him being fired/putting the IC in a position of being disciplined (by not fully whetting his complaints but believing it on his word - i think this IC built a lot of trust with this manager - did I make a mistake by not building as much trust?)
