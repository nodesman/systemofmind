If I had asked a question about why did I not get a bonus in that semester after the performance review I think it could have implicated the director too. Why? 

They told me I'm not meeting staff engineer expectations in Jan 2023 for not taking on an additional project. Apart from sprint work. He seemed to have been personally impacted by the performance review as my manager and seemed to show me behaviour of resentment. I undertook the project. I think in that performance review in June 2023 he cleared his own name as well as cleared me but unofficially told the director not to give me a bonus. So that he can justify it as the consequences of the unsanctioned and facade pip. 

Does my thinking seem far fetched and dumb? Give me your balanced and frank assessment please. The reason is wouldn't the HR who sits in the meeting ask why did the performance review not go well?
