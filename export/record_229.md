I have not met many people who are that harmful, like that, universally and completely draining and irritating to be around. I met only one other person recently. They were literal narcissists, attention seeking, not like my father, but some other, like his attention seeker. It's like, for example, and also he would, I think he would consciously or consciously put you down or something. He noticed that me and a girl at work, even if we're getting along, and he was, I think he did something to undermine me, like she put out her hand to shake my hand. I didn't see it. And I think he said something about me not having, you know, you put your hand out and they don't see it. And she, he undermined me, my mistake to her. So called cock blocking. So I have a feeling or rather, yeah, he lies, he gaslights, he's irritating to speak to, when showing code, he does things fast so that people don't get what's going on. He speaks unclearly. He changes events, what is told to one person or another person. He makes jokes about colonialism to someone like Indian. He makes jokes about, he talks about how, he constantly makes, he constantly makes jokes about other people's nationalities at work events, you know, everything. But this person is draining to interact with at all. But he's strangely different from my father who is just pure abrasive and says to most irritating things when spoken to. I've not met many extremely unpleasant people to be around. So that's what I'm not able to legitimize in this framework about my father. Can people be harmful just constantly
