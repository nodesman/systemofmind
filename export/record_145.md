What is the framework to close this:

The TCs thing is when my independence started - after TCS the arranged marriage forcing happened. 

Are there two interpretations for how to interpret his behavior post TCS and before TCS? 

before tcs - mostly abuse and pain and unsafe behavior

after tcs - some generosity? but we dont have to bifurcate like this - start from first principles and find a trend tha tmakes more sense - assume we have most things in the context already
