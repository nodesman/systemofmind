I mean.. i dont know what does it mean - that person thinks i am Indian right? That's what we decided my tiered response would be? Circle x where I will defend indian culture becasue ...? whether or not i like indian culture, that preson considers me Indian and they are attacking or disrespecting it. Does that mean. Sure I fight against anti Indian racism online. And we become Indians in that effort. I mean in that specific situation. How is me addressing bad behavior towards me an example of defend other Indians as was said by my brother. I am not asking you to side with me.. i need a logical breakdown please\n"
