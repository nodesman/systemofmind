My question:

Overcoming: Effects of Undermining that I went through

- What elements of undermining do we carry?
  - That I am not good enough to be a "Staff engineer" and never was
    - Why?
      - They offered me a higher salary because of the ZIRP period
      - "Then when it was over they raised expectations and so the real expectations came up and I don't seem to be stepping up to that"
      - The others seemed to have earned their staff engineer position by making a plan and performing at that level. I was hired into the staff engineer position. I was even given an award and additiona compensation in Q1 2022. But that may hae been a reactive experience to me asking for a higher salary in late 2021? I don't know I don't want to be self-defeating like this. Help me work through it and reach a clear understanding of my abilities

Your answer: 
You have real achievements. You reached staff engineer status, received an award and extra compensation, and you’re trusted enough that your company elevated you. Undermining thoughts can distort that reality. Here’s a process to rebuild clarity:

    Gather the Facts
    List out your achievements, responsibilities, and feedback. Include the award you received, the extra salary, and any successful projects you led. Seeing them in black and white helps push back against “I’m not good enough” thoughts.

        Citation: Carol Dweck’s Mindset explores how fixed mindsets underestimate growth and potential, while growth mindsets build on what’s already accomplished.

    Pinpoint Your Strengths
    Are you strong in architectural thinking, mentoring, problem-solving, or debugging? If you’re not sure, ask peers or recall times you performed at a higher level. Often, the traits that come naturally are the ones we forget to celebrate.

    Reflect on Feedback
    Sometimes “raising expectations” signals that others see potential in you—like a coach pushing an athlete to the next level. Pick out specific and consistent themes from performance reviews. These are your signposts for growth.

    Evaluate the Environment
    Companies change their focus when economic tides shift. They might start expecting more from senior staff once budgets tighten and product priorities change. Don’t let outside forces overshadow your core competence or your track record.

    Plan Forward
        Align with Company Goals: Identify immediate needs your team has and propose ways you can solve them. That’s how staff engineers show strategic vision.
        Lead Where You Are: Offer mentorship, share knowledge, and drive projects. Visibility and impact underscore your place.

        Citation: Will Larson’s Staff Engineer emphasizes owning your technical roadmap and acting as a force multiplier for the team.

    Counter Self-Defeat
    When you catch yourself in a negative spiral, re-center on your actual impact and facts. Yes, you negotiated a raise—and you’re still delivering real value. That negotiation alone shows you have confidence and skill.

You already have the abilities of a staff engineer. Put your accomplishments front and center, keep honing the talents you’re best at, and chart out ways to tackle higher-level objectives. These steps will help you see that you did earn your place.

What would say for what happened w.r.t my being a staff engineer. Is there anough evidence - Do you need to also see technical mettle to justify that I am staff level? Do I have unreasonable or reasonable imposter syndrome? Go on
