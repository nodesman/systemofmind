But in reality, being “stupid” usually points to something more nuanced:\n\t•\tContextual ignorance: not knowing something in a given moment (but possibly knowing much else).\n\t•\tBad judgment: failing to think through consequences.\n\t•\tCognitive limits: we all have blind spots, biases, and lapses.\n\t•\tSocial labeling: often “stupid” is just a dismissal, not an accurate description.\n\n\n\nWho was the stupidest of them all?\n"
