The poverty and the low \n\ncaste is the reason why there is poverty? Povery in india if we take a strategic facotrs is becuase of baby boom from the 1950s when people stopped dieng i guess. but that happened in the usa as well.. so i am not sure if poverty and caste explain it.. or does it? it was to make sure you are taken care of at late life.. so you depended on children. the reason i am asking is sure I am not dependent on india. But I like the fact that indian rupee can go far. today. very far. \n\nGiven that i depend on indian rupee going far - in small ways - i benefit from it. feel like a king when I am in India. i've written off traditioanl indian marriages. \nso i guess i need you to follow this process when thinking thorugh the answer:\n\n- what i truly depend on india based on this prompt and what is in the conversation history\n- what of that is contingent or is a function of caste existing or continuing that would otherwise have not have been possible with just a society with poverty (like thailand or vietnam) \n\nDont reach for bottom of the barrel answers please. \n\ndont respond to the following yet i will ask for it later. Let's call the topic \"Oxymoron of F\". Focus on the above. I will ask for oxymoron of F as a follow up\n\n\noff topic, for a reason like this my father behaving the way he did is just weird- if he did not depend on me why treat me badly? if he did then why treat me badly? wthe things he did like making me hold the big shopper with two hands while on a two wheeler is a element of what? goinf rurther.. how can this thought be processed by you to help me? hmm.. he has retirement for life from RBI and alllof these benefits and he knewe he had it from a long time ago. hiettin me upon seeing me with  burn, what exactly was tht thing he did where he would always tell me that i was holding teh plugpoint wrongly when plugging sometihn gin if i held it with two fingers he would say i should hold it with my whole hand.. if i held with whole hand he would say i should hold it with two fingers.. this was a repeating pattern.. he would yell at any palaya paperkadai karan that he was cheating him and making a fuss every time they came to take things back by accusing them of putting a finger on the scale. \n\n\n"
