Going back to the email of negotiation that we spoke about the final deadline email day when they said apology I mean they said today's a time sensitive and you get back on it immediately I responded saying apologies I did not see the original email only saw the reminder email I will get back to them as soon as possible on the deadline day when I saw that email I cried a bit because of the stress I was just wondering and I went to Rotterdam in a train and then I got to the library and then I opened the email and saw what they're offering and and then I sent the email at around three o'clock or two o'clock that I accepted and I was getting tired so I felt that that would be enough after taxes to have a decent runway or it can even end up being a saving grace in compensation for my troubles if I manage to find a new job quickly after that so that's pretty much it what do you think of the negotiation and did that orchestrated exploding offer what is how effective was it what did I manage to do what did I do
