Would your answer change knowing that HR had a sense that the toxic situation between me and th IC was reported a month before the manager decided to bully and do the littany meeting. Based on me giving them the 1-1 notes. And he made a dicriminatory remark in aug 2022 after disciplining the IC in Jan 2021 himself? I bring this up to point out the level of problems with him and how they would have handled it. 

Give me a general response as well as teh following:
- Seeing his actions in the context of directors' involvement and lack of involvment as two scenarios
- How would they have seen the whole situation with the knowledge of director's involvement/not involvement and how would htey have handled it
