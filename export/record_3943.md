It does indeed seem like I came accidentally to the best plce in the world for me. Sparing the weather. \n\nI guess in that sense I had something to work towards in life. But if i had been born with my skills in a country that was not trash to live in then I would have focused on emgiration and instead have enterprised and have may be even made it by now the way that pieter levels guy did. So I prioreitized emigraiton over enterprising for my personal goals. \n\nThe confusion now is I didn't have an idea for a better future - what am I living for wha makes me get up and look towards the future and what makes me do the routines that I do. The goal is \n\nIf I am going to be in the Netherlands forever then I have to keep this home clean have a nice small little routine that gets me doing that? \n\nSo I have decided that the goal of life is the pursuit of personal happiness and pleasure. That is all. I've disconnected from the shoulds and musts about a) where I must live to be worthy b) who i must have married. \n\nThe question now is - am I fully free of all inehrited static beucase I am eustioning everything. I am now eschewing Hinduism too. So is now life a matter of traversing around other inherited static systems or do you see any inheritd static at all. I am chosing to marry any nationality. Open to buying a home in Thaialdn becuase its good there. \n"
