  "content": "story of my life it seems like I spent my 20s escaping abuse from my parents one is a forced marriage and then the interference in my marriage that my parents did. In 2014 I got married and then she herself was a problem she was she was a snowflake so to speak they told me to treat her like a flower or something so basically it looks like people will say like you know your your pain is your liability almost being in pain is you and people continue to cause that pain. marriage fell apart and meaning from 2014 to 2017, 2016 my mother misbehaved in my house and I had to leave the house within two days. This pattern of controlling behavior, disrespectful behavior continued mostly from my mother. to spend then from 2017 and to 2023 surviving in the Netherlands away from them and trying to make a life and then I was granted naturalization and then I found that I left India because of all the abuse both societal and parents those are extremely unpleasant life that's the truth there's no way to change that real life was also difficult people were not nice people treat me very poorly so there was a lot of pain from that too I don't know if I'll ever heal from that pain. the truth is it hurts it looks like I spent almost 37 years of my life you know eking out whatever happiness I could while overcoming pain and from abuse while also experiencing more abuse later. still in somewhat of a survival mode where well I processed most of the abuse from the past I now have to work on building a stable life in the Netherlands. Spitting my time between the Netherlands and India is not that far It does look like I can do whatever I want, indulge myself in my male imperatives if you know what I mean, and freely and be happy, without judgment, in another words, I don't have to worry about anything. need to definitely do is I need to do is understand that I've spent almost 37 years escaping abuse abuse as well as escaping a horrific environment that's the truth there's no way around it"
