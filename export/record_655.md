We agree that a relationship is defined by respect and there was lack of it and every relationship that we analyzed. Or was harmful. I lived in a household with a lack of respect. \n\nWas all the harm from disrespect or .. i think being put in a jeopadrizing position by someone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nWhen you tolerate disrespect, even silently, two things happen:\n\t1.\tExternal reinforcement:\n\t•\tThe other person learns that this behavior is permissible with you.\n\t•\tThe social script between you locks in: “I can treat you this way, and you’ll accept it.”\n\t2.\tInternal reinforcement:\n\t•\tOn the surface, you may rationalize it (“not worth the fight,” “I’ll let it slide”).\n\t•\tBut at a deeper level, the brain encodes: I must deserve this treatment, or at least I cannot stop it.\n\t•\tEach repetition strengthens the neural association between self and being treated as lesser.\n\nOver time, this forms a self-perpetuating loop: the more you tolerate, the more natural it feels, the harder it is to resist. It becomes part of your mental conditioning—just like the status games in system A.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy it’s powerful\n\nHumans are associative learners. Every tolerated act of disrespect is not just an external event; it’s an internalized data point shaping self-concept.\n\t•\tIf repeated enough, you start predicting disrespect in future encounters.\n\t•\tYou may preemptively lower yourself to “avoid conflict.”\n\t•\tThis further normalizes the premise: my place is beneath.\n\n⸻\n\nThe flip side\n\nThe moment you refuse disrespect—by boundary-setting, withdrawal, or confrontation—you inject a new premise: I don’t deserve this.\n\t•\tThe first few refusals feel alien and risky.\n\t•\tBut each repetition rewires the loop in the opposite direction.\n\n```\n"
