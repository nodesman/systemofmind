This father bastard when trying to force me to marry that girl said “If you don’t marry her her life will be ruined”. Two things: he is my father and yet he is worried about.

He even pointed to some vague point from his own employer’s code of conduct to say he will lose his job if there are violations against women or something. (If so why didn’t he take that into account when doing this?) 

He told me that I am going to that home as a “gift”.

What is the premise of these statements and actions you are able to infer? 

For example the premise that who I marry, and then provide for is that easily dispensed with that you can just dispense it “because I committed” - a life long commitment and matter of concern? If so why did that matter not apply for that girl? Do you follow?
