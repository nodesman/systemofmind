Can you imagine how ti makes me feel to see the director write a glowing departure email ? He could have made a token gesture but he included phrases like "I learnt a lot from [my manager]" (incidentally does that mean he lost a major support and is now going ot be left to fend for himself and is now screwed? That seems like more evidence that he was complicit to me. But setting that aside.
