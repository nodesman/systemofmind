  "content": "Coming to the question of Indian society and its lack of reciprocity and the manner in which it treats men and what the expected script is towards the future. You mentioned the propagation of the caste is the rule and that caste itself is an invention of or rather propagation by Brahmins and gaslighted and you know they kept access to religion and maybe when every man was made into a prisoner and a god and then eventually slowly we were all made into and then society itself in my own life at least at least parenthood was not universally a two-sided goal or a provisional goal it was a almost instrumentalized goal. Most of Indian parenting is instrumentalization I think if we're talking about parenting is instrumentalization and society we pay taxes and the Indian central government takes it and gives it to quite that's at a state level my I'm sorry at the central level which is an extractive thing fine which is not entirely like a central government did they do their right by me they mostly did did the state government do right by me mostly no did they deliver power no roads were okay passable were they good no were they without potholes no most of the time they're okay and most of the time they're not okay sorry what else you expect to do dharma so that you will be will be rewarded in the next life and if you are fucked over that's also your fault okay so you expected to propagate the caste provide service provide be a provider suffer suffer suffer in Indian culture and when you don't do it random strangers will enforce it why are you living like this why are you not married things like that.\n\n\nThe question that I'm trying to build up to is the question of Am I in, you know, is the deal of India so bad? Look, we have discussed that the Indian deal is harmful, okay? I have to keep a boundary towards it from other Indians in many ways. In what other ways? I have to keep a boundary from other Indians about my marital life, what I'm doing with my life, what I'm going to do next. Why I'm living is for my personal happiness. If I ever tell Indians this, it will start becoming a problem. Another, we already know also that racists like white Americans, people who identify as white Americans, they have a harmful identity which is not in peace with our identity. So, my point again is, while Indian society is uniquely harmful, I mean, does it mean I'm not harmed? What about Indian society that makes me have to draw a boundary with Indians? What about Indian society? Okay, I have to have a similar boundary with Arabs. I have to have a similar boundary with people who identify as white, like Americans. I have to have a similar boundary with, not similar, but maybe for different reasons. Boundary with the Dutch people, with other Europeans, with French people, things like that, right? With the people from Britain, with Pakistanis, with Chinese. Is the Chinese experience a complete totalitarian level of path one? Going to that too.\n\nMy, again, my, I'm meandering all over the place, I'm still thinking things through. I hope you'll work with me and find the meaning in my words. This is a transcript. There are many, many cultures and many, many types of people, Muslims, with whom I have to have some other boundary. So, I have to learn the concept of boundaries so that I can exist peacefully in this world and maximize my happiness and privacy and get the most out of the world, right? My question, again, is around Chinese. Is there entire, like, it's a state-enforced inherited static path one, or can you also be inherited, you know, derived dynamic or inherited static, inherited dynamic, but on a path to, in China, as a Chinese person? Uyghurs are not allowed to do their thing in private? Are chinese people allowed to pray in monasteries as buddhists? What about tibet? \n"
