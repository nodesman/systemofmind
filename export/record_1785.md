I am trying to word this phenomenon somehow so that I can be on the look out for it:

- What my former manager did - try to “control” someone else’s behaviour by creating a feeling of fear in them - he did that litany of complaints meeting to do what? “Soften me up”? to be suggestible for the things that happened after that? (to me this seems to cross the boundary where you use seek to change the actions of another person free will of another person) (can you confirm if this is what happened? no right? something else? start from first principles - review conversation, elucidate what happened and summarise it)
- My father did something similar in my life - where he beat me in order to force me to come with him to the doctor to get the  medicine for my brother because the doctor wanted to see a child with him when giving said medicine and he thinking he didn’t want to have to explain to me the urgency because he had to go to work but had to get the medicine now. 

What is the pattern of behaviour here? Can you help me word it?
