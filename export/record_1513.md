Is it possible that this belief is not based on current, hard evidence, but is a **deeply held, romantic ideal** that you need to be true?\n>\n> Is it possible that you are clinging to the idea of a \"perfectly just\" professional world as an **antidote to the profound injustice** you have experienced in your own life (from your family to your past jobs)?\n>\n> And what would it mean for you if you were to accept that **no such perfect meritocracy exists anywhere**, and that even at Google, life is a complex and often political game?\n\n\nYes it is possible that it is a romantic ideal. How else does a engineering deparment run? Leave out the part where one is getting promoted on merit. What about decent professional conduct in technical discussions - things are argued. Openly discussed - we debate approaches when trying to do our jobs. That is what i wanted. Not too much I think. \n\nI don't want a perfect meritocracy at least something trying to be a good one. At least there is no bias agaisnt people of any nationality. There is a lot of effort into process to at least try to be fair to people. That is what I wanted. I read about this Uber engineering manager how he did have promotion packets. \n"
