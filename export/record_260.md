There is a common pattern in the many disparate examples - him trying to dismiss someone protesting him cutting in line, him doing a lackdaisical or namesake taking me to a park on the suggestion of my teachers, the manner in which he handled the arranged marriage specifically the way he dealt with that fmaily and me on the phone without care ofr what one wanted - it ook him almost 2 weeks for the news to reach is noggin that i didn't want that marriage after i told them repeatedly and they just kept dismissing or acting like i didnd't say antyhing at all and kept ong doing things involving arranging the marriage - including making commitments to that family of my visit and getting a family friend to accomapny me to some gift shop to give to that girl and asking me to go when i said id dint want to marry - there is something in all of this i am not able t put in words"
