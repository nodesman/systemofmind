the anger of having gone through it and this guy having done it and all the things that he did and look I don't know for a middle-class person in India are you able to reasonably come up with a for someone who became an RBI so-called clerk and for 10 years 15 years and then became a bank manager in our grade a officer was his behavior see poverty of course people in poverty they behave indecently but how do I compare him to say if his behavior is on par or subpar or deviant or indecent or how are you able to come up with a reasoning for how to place him and his behavior?" So that I can be appropriately angry?" I guess.
