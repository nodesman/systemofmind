  "content": "<p>He orchestrated the multi-day effort to discourage actions and tie it to losing my job as a fear—so this was an orchestration. I am trying to ask what allowed it to be detected and backfire. Would this have worked with other people? Was the expectation that I will see it, even if it was transparent as 'consequence,' and accept it as a performance outcome? Or was it calculated blackmail and coercion?</p> <p>He even did things like saying, ‘IC has say on your performance’ in response to that IC saying I argued or something in a meeting with him. Implying what? That I should fear him? So that I don’t ask questions? Imagine asking an engineer to do that? What does it say about his understanding of engineering? Imagine a manager asking a report to fear another report—another IC? Shocking to me, the level of toxicity of this manager’s approach to management.</p> <p>What I want to ask, I guess, is what about me allowed the orchestration to first not work—meaning he planned to mangle me into fearing someone in the team by doing that. Does that mean it will work with other people? Does it mean he has done this with others?</p> <p>Imagine importing fear into someone else for your personal agenda that has nothing to do with that person’s flaws by doing a shock-and-awe thing—overwhelming them and creating a smoke-and-mirrors effect of problems, stress, and confusion. Disorienting them by giving vague and conflicting information so that they don’t know what is going on while avoiding conversation—so that you can, among the smoke, ask for not doing the behaviors that seem to bother the IC and tie it to performance and them keeping their job.</p> <p>Combine the earlier assessment with this. I am trying to ask what kind of a person he is—we have to go around in life assessing this about the important relationships, don’t we? What about me allowed this to not work—meaning would other people have succumbed to this manipulation? Why did it not work with me?</p> <p>I left not because of detecting the coercion and smoke-and-mirrors as having occurred—they happened over a period of weeks. So the smoke-and-mirrors effect happened over weeks. Imagine thinking this is some kind of management ingenuity. Imagine how you think of employees to do something like this—people with families. Children.</p> <p>Tell me also why it was detected by me. And what I also want to know is what I should keep doing that will keep me from being affected by similar manipulative orchestration and misdirection-type behaviors.</p>"
