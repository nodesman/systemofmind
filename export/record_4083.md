The following is a conversation I had with chatgpt:\n\n\n```\nSkip to content\nYou said:\nHow would you appropriate a person, I don't know, suppose he's gay, and he has to enter an airline, a plane full of people who are Muslim, if he keeps it to himself, relax, normal, nothing will happen? What will happen? Not that you know for sure that those people individually have told you that they don't like your beliefs or your sexual orientation, but if everyone is wearing a hijab or has Islamic attire, what would that person likely feel?\nChatGPT said:\n\nLet me break this down clearly.\n\nIf a gay man boards a plane where most passengers are visibly Muslim (say, wearing hijabs, kufis, or other Islamic attire), what happens depends on two separate things:\n\n    External reality — how others actually respond.\n\n    Internal perception — what he himself feels in that moment.\n\n1. External reality\n\n    Simply being gay is not something others can see unless he announces it or makes it the focus of his behavior.\n\n    On an airplane, people are usually concerned with their own travel, family, or prayers — not with scanning strangers for identity markers.\n\n    Muslims, like any large group, are not homogeneous. Some are conservative, others liberal, some don’t care at all about strangers’ sexuality.\n\n    Airlines, especially international ones, operate under aviation law and codes of conduct. Open harassment or violence on a plane is rare and would trigger immediate intervention.\n\nSo: if he keeps his orientation private (the way most straight or gay people do in public), nothing would likely happen.\n2. Internal perception\n\n    He might feel anxious or self-conscious. That’s natural, because he’s projecting what he thinks others believe onto their clothing and symbols.\n\n    Seeing a large group dressed in visibly religious attire can heighten a sense of “difference.” He may imagine disapproval, even without evidence.\n\n    This is closer to a psychological or social discomfort than an objective threat.\n\nThe Likely Experience\n\n    Outwardly: uneventful. He boards, sits, flies.\n\n    Inwardly: possibly tense, cautious, scanning for signs of hostility — though most people around him are probably focused on getting to their destination.\n\nA good way to think of it: the risk is low, but the perceived risk is higher, because of stereotypes, past stories of intolerance, or his own sense of vulnerability.\n\nWould you like me to contrast how this scenario might actually differ if the flight were, for example, from Amsterdam to Istanbul versus Riyadh to Jeddah? The cultural context of where the plane is flying matters a lot.\nYou said:\nLet's say, this is an extreme version, but let's say there's another culture where the person of that culture is not at peace with people of his own culture. It can be someone who, yeah, I don't know, maybe, I don't want to anchor the thing, but this person doesn't like some things. He believes that his own culture has a lot of negative, damaging narratives. And there are a lot of such people in his surroundings, and they are in the same airline, in the plane, they're about to board, I mean, they're about to take off. They're in a plane. What is likely to happen? How is that person likely to feel? And this is not this Arab gay example, this is just, I'm trying to go to a more wider example.\nChatGPT said:\n\nI see where you’re going — you’re widening the frame from “a gay man among visibly Muslim passengers” to “a person who feels at odds with their own culture, surrounded by people who embody it.”\n\nLet’s split this into external reality and internal experience, as before.\n1. External reality\n\n    On a plane, most people are passive — they sit, wait, follow instructions, distract themselves. They’re not there to interrogate anyone’s beliefs.\n\n    Even if this person disagrees with the culture around them, unless they voice it or behave confrontationally, nothing practical will likely happen.\n\n    Planes are structured, rule-bound environments. The crew enforces calm and safety.\n\nSo outwardly, the flight proceeds normally.\n2. Internal experience\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting.\n\n    Alienation: Surrounded by symbols of the culture they critique, they may feel out of place, like an “outsider within.”\n\n    Heightened tension: Every gesture or conversation from those around them might feel loaded, even if neutral.\n\n    Projection: The person may assume disapproval, hostility, or judgment from others, simply because they are immersed in a group they don’t identify with.\n\n    Cognitive dissonance: A sense of “these are my people biologically/ethnically, but ideologically I don’t belong.” That can create deep discomfort.\n\nIn other words, the likely outcome is not an external confrontation but an internal storm: unease, vigilance, maybe resentment, maybe guilt.\nThe broader pattern\n\nWhat you’re describing is a universal psychological situation:\n\n    A secular person on a pilgrimage flight full of religious compatriots.\n\n    A politically liberal dissenter in a cabin full of flag-waving nationalists.\n\n    An atheist in a sea of co-religionists from their birth culture.\n\nExternally: nothing happens.\nInternally: the person feels trapped in a moving symbol of what they’ve rejected.\n\nSo, to answer directly:\n\n    Likely external outcome: nothing unusual, just a flight.\n\n    Likely internal outcome: heightened discomfort, a sense of being “other” even within one’s own people, and perhaps a desire to get off the plane as soon as possible.\n\nDo you want me to frame this more through psychology (alienation, in-group/out-group dynamics), or through social anthropology (how identity and belonging shift when you reject parts of your inherited culture)?\n\n```\n"
