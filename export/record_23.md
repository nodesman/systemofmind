I have a question. Is how we see other people reflected on how they see us? Meaning, let's say you have internalized racism. Is how you see someone who is of a so-called, that racism says they are of a higher race? Is that non-verbally known by them? I don't know why I should believe your answer, but I'm asking you anyway. You might say yes, but why should I believe you? And why am I asking you? God damn it!
