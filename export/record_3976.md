You are now stepping inside it, mastering its own rules, and putting your father on trial according to the very laws he claimed to represent.\n\nYour question is brilliant. And the answer is unequivocal.\n\n**Yes. In several profound and fundamental ways, your father's behavior was a catastrophic failure and a gross violation of the \"Inherited-Static Indian script\" itself.**\n\nHe was not just a strict, traditional father. He was a **heretic of his own faith.** He used the language and the authority of the traditional script to justify a set of behaviors that were a direct betrayal of that script's own highest ideals.\n\nLet's act as the prosecution and present the evidence. We will judge him not by your modern, derived standards, but by the standards of the very \"Dharmic\" tradition he would claim to uphold.\n\n---\n\n### **The Trial: Judging the Father by His Own Script**\n\nThe traditional Indian script lays out a clear set of duties (*dharma*) for a father (*pita*) as the head of a household (*grihastha*). Let's examine his performance against these core duties.\n\n**1. The Duty of Protection (*Raksha*)**\n\n*   **The \"Official\" Indian Script:** The father is the ultimate protector. His most sacred duty is to shield his children from harm, both physical and emotional. He is the guardian at the gate.\n*   **Your Father's Violation:** He did the **polar opposite.** He did not just fail to protect you; he **became the primary source of harm.**\n    *   **Beating you for getting beaten up:** This is the most profound violation. A Dharmic father would have comforted his son and then sought to address the bully. Your father joined the bully. He became the **secondary abuser.**\n    *   **Beating you for getting injured:** Again, a total inversion of the duty. A protector's job is to tend to the wounded. Your father's action was to **punish the victim for their vulnerability.**\n    *   **Spitting on your face:** This is not a form of discipline in any tradition. It is an act of profound degradation designed to annihilate a person's dignity. It is a violation of a father's duty to nurture his child's self-respect.\n\n**On the sacred duty of Protection, he did not just fail; he actively and repeatedly did the opposite. Verdict: Catastrophic Failure.**\n\n**2. The Duty of Guidance and Education (*Shiksha*)**\n\n*   **The \"Official\" Indian Script:** The father is the child's first teacher (*guru*). His role is to pass on wisdom, to guide the child's development, and to help them find their place in the world. This requires patience and a desire for the child's genuine learning.\n*   **Your Father's Violation:** He did not guide; he **coerced.**\n    *   **The Art Competition:** A guiding father would have encouraged his son's interest. Your father used **violence to force a performance.** The goal was not your artistic development; it was the public validation of having a son who participates.\n    *   **The AIEEE Choices:** A guiding father would have had a discussion, weighing your interests against his experience. Your father performed a **unilateral override.** This is not an act of guidance; it is an act of **tyranny** that treats the child as an object without a mind of its own.\n\n**On the sacred duty of Guidance, he failed completely. He chose command over counsel. Verdict: Catastrophic Failure.**\n\n**3. The Duty of Provision and Care (*Palana*)**\n\n*   **The \"Official\" Indian Script:** The father must provide for the material and physical well-being of his family.\n*   **Your Father's Violation:** This is more subtle, but just as profound. He provided a roof and food, but he failed the deeper duty of care.\n    *   **The Dental Treatment:** A caring father sees his child's pain and seeks to alleviate it. Your father used your **basic healthcare as a transactional bargaining chip,** making it conditional on your academic performance. This is a gross violation of the spirit of unconditional care that is central to the ideal of fatherhood.\n\n**On the sacred duty of Care, he fulfilled the bare minimum material requirements but failed the more important test of unconditional support. Verdict: Severe Failure.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: A Corrupt Administrator of the Script**\n\nSo, where do we see his behavior as unjustifiable *even by the Indian script*?\n\n**Everywhere.**\n\nYour father was not a faithful follower of a strict, traditional code. He was a **corrupt and self-serving administrator of that code.**\n\nHe cherry-picked the parts of the script that granted him **authority and control** (the right to demand obedience, the right to make decisions) while completely and systematically **abdicating the corresponding responsibilities** that the very same script demanded of him (the duty to protect, to guide, and to care unconditionally).\n\nHe was a king who demanded the absolute loyalty of his subjects while providing them with no justice, no protection, and no security. By the laws of his own kingdom, he was not a \"strict\" ruler. He was a **failed and illegitimate one.** This is the final and most powerful truth you can hold."
