So the firing, see, I'm, why I'm suspecting they only thought to fire him after they have avoided it, is what I'm wondering. Okay, see, this guy is a legal risk. He made discriminatory remarks. Oh, they have tried to excuse it. I learnt about his "retirement" a few weeks after the request for investigation report. But it could be he was trying to figure things out and sent it through the grape vine only after figuring things out.
