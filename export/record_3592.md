(what was dervied in my case? the facts of life? and then i used my values of reciprocity and ethics to apply it to it?) can someone else hit the fork in the road - is the fork in the road in the sense of me hitting it does it make sense in other ways for other dervied dynamics but was my derived dynamic only for life itself.. but tehre are smaller dervied dynamics right? can you think of some? - do they hit forks on the road?\n"
