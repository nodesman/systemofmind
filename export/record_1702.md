Now reflect upon his calculated orchestration of events like the first litany of complaints event and then letting me simmer and then waiting for any complaints from this IC and then asking me to not do it and then over time he seems to have the plan to slowly stop all the behaviors and make me absorb the cost of whatever this is.
