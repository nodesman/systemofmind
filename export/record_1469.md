It required you to be constantly vigilant, to expect the worst in interactions, and to maintain a critical distance from the people around you.\n>\n> Now that you are in the Netherlands—a high-trust, low-friction society—how does this \"armor\" serve you today? When you interact with a Dutch person (a shopkeeper, a colleague, a potential friend), which of these two experiences is more common?\n>\n> **A) A Feeling of Relief and Safety:** Does your armor allow you to relax, because you can quickly see that the \"threat\" is gone? Do you find it easy to switch off the \"expect the worst\" mindset and engage with people from a place of trust and openness?\n>\n> **B) A Feeling of Persistent Vigilance and Distance:** Does the armor stay on out of habit? Do you still find yourself unconsciously scanning for how you might be \"screwed over,\" even in a simple interaction? Do you find it difficult to let go of the analytical, critical distance and connect with people on a more vulnerable, open-hearted level?\n\n\nOn contraire I recently had expreiences in Netherlands in two workplaces where I found myself being screwed over. In the first one I actually suffered a lot because of the behaviors I witnessed and while I succeeded in holding perpetrators accountable in the second one not having had the level of analyst mind would have ended very badly for me. \n\nOf late I have been thinkign I have been too trusting of systems here. And there are viable risks to be aware of. I don't recall having caught anyone other than at the workpalce from that level of. I was let down by this mortgage broker that had me scrambling to exit a bad real estate deal. By lining up exit statements from multiple banks. Let down by the medical system that had me suffering for years doing talk therapy instead of giving me what i actually needed which was fluoxetine - having had that years earlier would ahve resulted in recovery far earlier and i would have move on to next few things in life. I needlessly suffered for years. in the first employer i should have been even more aggressive getting an employment alwyer involved but i hadn't yet gotten to the point of dealing with employers with laywers in this country at the time. Granted I received reimbursement from the legal system for my criminal defense when I was interrogated for the false domestic violence report by my ex-wife. \n\nSo recently I actually defined stupid and naive as not expecting enough bad to happen which I may have allowed to do in this society as well. While I will allow myself to trust but allowing for outcomes is important. Trust but verify. This is a work in progresss still. \n\nBut do I think I have a paranoia. And cynicism that is a carry over from India? Perhaps not. Of late not enough. There are dysfunctions here that one needs to learn and overcome. Such as by going to india, getting the diagnosis and having this country do the treatment and not make me do the run around. Are people in general trust worthy in teh public sphere - yes. Mostly. I don't feel that need to ask how much something is before buying it. I am able to interact with people at a opoen hearted level actually even in india if we are able to establish that we are in the same social strata economically speaking. Or not even that in some contexts like in a mall with people not necessarily in as good economically. I did move to a new country and pioneered a new life here so there are threats to be aware of here right? I took the risk. \n\nThink about this passage:\n\n```\n\nMigration has a strong selection effect: the people who manage to leave their home country and resettle somewhere else are not a random sample of the population. They’re usually the ones with more drive, ambition, resilience, or resources. That’s why they often end up adapting well and sometimes even outperforming locals in building stable lives.\n\nSociology and economics research back this up — it’s sometimes called the migrant self-selection hypothesis (Borjas, 1987; Chiswick, 1999). The very difficulty of migration means it filters for people who are willing and able to take on risk, hard work, and adaptation.\n```\n"
