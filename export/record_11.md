I can, I'm okay with you pushing back on this, but I think she was just talking freely and I don't think she was, uh, uh, you know, asserting a boundary about her boyfriend. Maybe she felt saying whatever she wanted and boyfriend was one of the things that she mentioned, but push back against me if this is me coping. It's okay, but she clearly liked me, right? Then if she was single, she would have taken things further. She would have kept talking. You make it sound like, uh, I wasn't interesting at all.
