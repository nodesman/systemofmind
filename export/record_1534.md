I am sorry btu this seems like a highly specific kind of toxicity to be on the look out for. but that is my opinion. you don't have to agree with me. i am relieved if you tell me that it is not and that there is a useful lesson for my career to learn ehre.  i can only do the kind of professional manuvering that can help me overcome problems but is htis such a commonplace hazard for me to change how i operate as a professional?
