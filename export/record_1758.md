During my time under this manager, they operated with a belief that they could get away with manipulative behavior because they avoided making explicit blackmail statements, relying instead on oral insinuations and veiled threats. One significant example was their handling of my performance review, which they manipulated to ensure I lost my bonus. They repeatedly brought up the possibility of a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), creating a persistent and stressful atmosphere of uncertainty.

Their behavior oscillated between hostility and manipulative friendliness. In earlier meetings, they acted angrily and even taunted me, but later they would intersperse praise in what felt like a deliberate attempt to manipulate or disorient me. For instance, after threatening me with a potential PIP, they casually smiled and asked, "How are things going, man?" This seemed designed to normalize the situation or undermine the severity of their earlier statements.

Separately, I observed concerning behavior involving a younger colleague, an early 20s Italian woman. Another manager (not the one I am discussing) appeared to normalize inappropriate conduct in the workplace. When someone unexpectedly hugged her from behind, leaving her surprised and seemingly uncomfortable, this other manager remarked, "What's wrong?" as if to downplay or justify the behavior.

Throughout this ordeal, I stood firm in refusing to let this environment dictate what constitutes appropriate workplace behavior. I pushed back against the normalization of hostility and indecency disguised as professional conduct. However, I recognize that this resistance may have been one of several factors contributing to the conflict.

i want to ask you your thoughts. They were making attempts to normalize maniulative behavior. It is not like a lie or something this was forced actions - like creating a fear to "fall in liine" this was dsigusting. I mean why would you be a indecent human being?
