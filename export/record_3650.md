  "content": "Or is it fair - it was not like I was uniquely failed by Tamil culture or wsa it possible for them to do it but they did not? They have good raods and public facilities elsewhere? In India? They did better than TN in delivery of public services? I am not bargaining. I am asking.. did TN fail to delliver pubilc services becuase of India or did TN failed because of TN (corruption)? If you agree that TN failed me in services, then, how is the reciprocity + respect equation looking? My culture is not beign respected by people of other states but does that mean every day individual treat me with disrespect in other states? No. Not always. along the same lines - are everyday Tamils always treating me with respect? You mentioned that I got the honor of the tamil cutlure as a mark of my respect but is that how we account htis? you seem to be putting a square peg in a round hole. Or i could be wrong. In light of this clarification, how we we see the earlier point?\n"
