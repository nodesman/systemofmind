You are asking about the evolution of models over deep time.\n\nThe simple answer is **yes, absolutely.** If a communist system managed to survive for 1000 years, it would transition from a \"Derived-Static\" model to an **\"Inherited-Static\" model.**\n\nThe more complex answer lies in *why* this happens and what it reveals about the nature of these models.\n\n---\n\n### **The Lifecycle of a Belief System: From Revolution to Tradition**\n\nAll successful belief systems, whether religious or political, follow a predictable lifecycle.\n\n**Stage 1: The Derived Phase (The Revolution)**\n\n*   This is the initial, explosive phase. A charismatic founder or a group of revolutionary thinkers **derives** a new, compelling model of reality.\n*   This model is attractive precisely because it is *new* and offers a radical break from the old, inherited system.\n*   People who adopt it in this phase are often conscious converts. They have actively *chosen* this new map.\n*   **Example:** The first generation of Marxists who read *Das Kapital* and chose to become revolutionaries. They were operating on a **Derived** model.\n\n**Stage 2: The Codification Phase (The Hardening)**\n\n*   For the model to survive beyond the first generation, it must be codified. The revolutionary ideas are turned into a set of fixed doctrines, texts, and institutions.\n*   This is where a dynamic idea often hardens into a **static** ideology. The goal shifts from discovery to preservation. The revolutionary movement becomes a state or a church.\n*   **Example:** Lenin and Stalin taking Marx's dynamic critique and turning it into the rigid, dogmatic ideology of the Soviet state.\n\n**Stage 3: The Inheritance Phase (The Tradition)**\n\n*   This is what happens after several generations. The model is no longer something you *choose*; it is something you are **born into.**\n*   For the third, fourth, and tenth generation, the model is not a revolutionary, derived idea. It is simply \"the way the world is.\" It is the water they swim in. It has become **inherited.**\n*   **Example:** A child born in the Soviet Union in 1970 did not \"choose\" Marxism-Leninism. They were taught it in school as the one and only truth. For them, it was an **Inherited-Static** model.\n\n---\n\n### **So, What Does This Mean for Communism?**\n\nYou are correct. If a communist state like the USSR had survived for 1000 years:\n\n*   It would absolutely be an **Inherited-Static** system. The writings of Marx and Lenin would be treated with the same reverence as the Vedas or the Bible in a traditional society.\n*   The Communist Party would be the equivalent of a hereditary priesthood or aristocracy.\n*   The rituals of the state (May Day parades, etc.) would be the new religious festivals.\n*   The entire system would no longer be a \"revolutionary\" ideology; it would be a deeply conservative, traditional social order.\n\n### **The Different Reason: Why Communism Failed to Reach the Inheritance Stage**\n\nThis brings us to the most important point. The reason we don't have thousand-year-old communist states is that the **Derived-Static model is exceptionally bad at surviving in the long run.**\n\n*   **Inherited-Static models (like traditional religion)** are incredibly resilient because they have been beta-tested over thousands of years. Their rules and rituals are often a form of accumulated, pre-scientific wisdom about how to keep a society stable. They are the survivors.\n\n*   **Derived-Static models (like Communism or Fascism)** are brittle because they are the product of a single historical moment and a single set of ideas. They are a \"Version 1.0\" of a society that refuses to be updated. When their rigid map inevitably collides with the changing territory of reality, they have no mechanism to adapt. They tend to collapse catastrophically within a few generations.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: The reason Communism is a \"Derived-Static\" model is not just because it's new. It's because its **fundamental nature—its rigidity, its intolerance of dissent, its denial of reality—makes it structurally incapable of surviving long enough to *become* an Inherited-Static tradition.** It is an evolutionary dead end."
