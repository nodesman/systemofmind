The other thing that I mean I don't think I properly conveyed what I was trying to convey this uh I so you know it's like a way of functioning in society where you deal with such with every interaction at that moment you act like some it's almost like animalistic you don't have a reason you know you react in the moment which say something that is necessary we said for example this bastard father took me to Mumbai to on a trip somewhere and then he someone was complaining that uh he was cutting in line and he was uh dismissing them okay that's not I'm not able to I'm not able to explain it uh basically in interactions he will say what is necessary to get it done so he he he cannot be reasoned into doing something he cannot be told or rather he won't listen he has my mother told tells me that he has never had a reasonable discussion with him about anything which is very odd he has never had any prolonged discussion with me about anything life anything no nothing they only do this do that uh there was no discussion around why do something why do something else nothing zero never took me somewhere to do so uh also combine that with the fact that this one time in school my teacher told him to take me to some park teacher told him to take me to some park in Hyderabad so that they can be relationship better relationship between me and him and he did it once and then he found out that I did it once and then he found out that I kept some paper from apparently kept some uh paper mark sheet from him the whole problem in that is she said that because she wanted to suggest a solution to keep me from keeping the mark sheets from him okay to suggest two men relationship which is a sad thing for a teacher to have to do for a parent and a child but it happened to me so setting that aside uh he expected by taking me to the park once he expected some outcome it's like he despite me doing it you did this within he did it on a Friday and then he expected results on Monday it was like that he took a day off from from work and you know I remember feeling like I remember feeling this like this was it is felt forced anyway there was no positive uh it felt forced yeah
