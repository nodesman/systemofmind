It was that belief that I had to belong in a society that gives me standing in the eyes of peoples of other societies that have a totem pole in judging the peoples of the world. Like koreans and arabs and chinese? If I find myself at the disadvantage in that totem pole then? But which gives me greater standing? Can you ask me questions that can help unravel any associated believes or confusions in thsi area? But then if they are anyway judging me by my skin color does it matter in most circumstanes which passport I am? How would my nationality come up unless in the immigration counter in the airport or if we are discussing my residence. I am not saying this is not relevant. In some abstract sense my nationality can become relevant in some future scenarios that I may find myself in. I have this abstract belief that I will find myself in moments when my wealth and my passport power will come into relevance in some situations. But here is the thing - goign by that french persons post how relevnat is it those - keep in midn we are still discussing the totem pole of Dutch vs American life. But if we are being honest how far the American passport is, the dutch passport is the only viable one. I imainge some scenario where I am able to demand respect in Korea where they are racist as hell and not be treated like they would treat a Indian (but do I want to pursue this on the basis of my passport? am i drawign my identity from this country which i was not born into but adopted? i am not ethnically of it? does that endeavor seem self-defeating? tell me) it does seem like a pyrric victory in that sense  - a indian person with American passport. at the end of the day i carry myself as brown and that means what in the world sense? what exactly do I tihnk is going to happen in those moments  when I meet an arab person in UAE in public or korean in korea or chiense in china htat is helped by my.. what citizenship? i can help it i guess by dressing well and looking good. both for myself and ot differentiate from most indians. i feel that to be a practical necessity and doing so is it self-defeating and negative? \n\ndo you think there are piercing questions to ask that would help clarify any confusion in my identity including dislodge and uncover any lack of clariyt or negative beliefs that yous ense may be there? we can embark on another tree based traversal also or is this alrady covered in what we spoke?\n"
