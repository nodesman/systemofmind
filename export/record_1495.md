People in India went to office, came back. It was largely something like you, society, or rather the habits and culture was handed down by people older than you. They were told how to live life, how to make it in life. Can you imagine that I emigrated to another country by way of applying to a job online, attending an interview online? I am literally in another part of the world. When my brother just followed my cousin and followed the real charted path. The past newspapers were the arbiters of truth. It would seem that at the time they were hand-in-glove with the states people, the deep states, New York Times, and so on and so forth. They were hand-in-glove with the power sectors in shaping public opinion. You couldn't see first-hand what was actually going on. They selected truths for you. But today with social media it is no longer like that. You can't hide what's going on. People post videos first-hand, which is all happening on the Anglophone internet too. It would seem that we have moved into another kind of world. And in this new world we are in the Anglophone world forever. For one, it is because it is easier to keep going as against creating more divisions and creating other worlds. Do I even myself want the Tamil internet to improve? I don't know. Maybe. Will the Tamil internet run the risk of being overwhelmed? Perhaps. Possible. What I am trying to say is it would seem we are forever stuck. We have changed where reality is because in a sense the Anglophone world, the Anglophone internet is where reality is instead of newspapers. And the real world culture used to be passed on through conversations but it's more now on the internet. And here's the other thing. I don't want you to say yes Raj, you're right. But this is how I see it. This might seem like stating the obvious but it's not my intent. This is not something people are noticing well enough. My point is in the future we are going to keep going. We're going very fast. The Anglophone internet is going to keep on going. And it's going to define our reality. One of the hazards of existing in the Anglophone internet is being exposed to American and British societal issues.\n```\n"
