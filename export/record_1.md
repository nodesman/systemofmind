I went to thise bakery place in thanjavur i am not sure what to make of it. I am hoping for a balanced response from you.. keep in mind that this is a bakery in thanjavur. I would about once a week go there or i would say even less than that and buy two chicken puffs, two veg puffs, thumsup i would have spent approximately 200 rs or sometimes just 80 â‚¹. sometimes just a coke for 40. they asked me where I am from and i said i live in palliagraharm. that place is about 8km from my home but they've seen me about a dozen times.. does this sufficiently explain why they seem to remember me or be nice to me
