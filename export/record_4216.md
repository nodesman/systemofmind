Kindness from a father is not a norm in India. (Is it not though? isn't it basic human nature to love your children and be loving to them?)\t thereofer you must not regret it. (The kind of kindness where father takes pleasure it getting things for children or takign them to places and taking interest in their happiness - actively plays with them)\n\n2. I am rejecting the idea of relative privation and therefore I should not take into consideration that I was born into Indian culture therefore that itself is a tragedy and lamentable outcome to regret and as a result I didn't get kindness (setting aside the lack of harm)\n\n3. I deserve a good childhood as does everyone else in the world and therefore I did not get what i deserved. But it would seem most people in the world also did not therefore ...? Not a tragdy? Do you agree with the premises of this question or not? I am open to being disagreed. \n\n4. In arab culture I doubt they are very nice ot children. Are they carrying pain from childhood? Similarly in china. They likely are super instrumentalized at home and by the state and by tehir futre wife. Which brings me to the point of \"Deserving\" as a function of culture. Sure by Indian culture I deserve to not be harmed that is for certain. Even if we don't see that practiced even 50% of the way in practice in the 90s. That generation's parents beat their children. Some far worse than me. So self-esteem is w.r.t deserve and not deserve in that culture? Are you saying then that. \n\n5. We know my personality traits - the trait hat made me not call him father from a very young age after experiencing wht id id with him. That was my ability to keep my respect for myself while he meted out the absue that he did. I idn't want to give him the words father while he behaved the way he did. Surely there are children somewhere in arab countries who are suffering like me I am sure. \n\n6. Are we then saying no child in teh world in hisotry deserved the kind of horrific instrumentalizing upbringing that was normal for most o fhistory. But if so how did we survive so many gernations? Is being able to withstand that a part of our evolution? And not beign abel to do that a deficiency? Do you first of all agree with the premises in this question?\n\n7. If chinese culture, arab and indian are instrumentalizing and it seem my brother doesn't see an issue with it. Does it mean my innate personality is a function of how to make sense of it. If so aren't there preople who are in those cultures with my personality? \n\nI would like you to address each of the points above in your answer explicitly in the process of while trying to derive the correct answer. Give logical reasoning for how it fits or doesn't fit. We are going to take multi step process for this. \n\nAs a first effort \n0. Tell me which of these have overlapping ideas and if they can be combined into one idea. or split up into multiople or both?  \n1. tell me in which order does it make the most sense to address these issues? \n\nOnly these two answers please nothing else. \n\n"
