Sometimes I feel like if I can have a massive impact on someone's life a very nuanced and unique advice then \n\nI guess I get satisfaction from being able to impact smoeone's life in a unique way. Like a unique advice or thought. It feels good to be valued. Like the couple I met at pattya. \n\nBut what does that indicate? Empthy that needs curtailing? May be writing a book about it and seeing how people react to it is a good way to get that validation. \n\nBut someo f the times this runs the risk of not being valued (but being valued or not is a outcome after giving?)\n\nThere are limits within which I can and should act. When you say I shouldn't become excessively giving. I should make it a point to not give to people who show no interest at all. That makes sense. \n"
