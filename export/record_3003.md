I can undertand or somewhat tolerate the appointments that are not immediately available but i canot accept that the GP put me ona  backlog for 6 months imgine if i had waited 6 montsh to get the  medicine or iwho ever i spoke to in NPA again sent me to therapy  cbt. What if those cunts in sinai centrum in 2018 should have prescrbed anti depressants instead of having me wait 6 months. combined with the booking.com fored manipulated exit lawyer's failure who didn't emphasiz that they had no basis for a PIP the professionals i've been dealing with most of them have not lived up to the reputation that a first world country should have had. based on your own understanding of what was said - the booking.com MTa laywer not fihting for me but instead saying my legal entitlement is this much but they are offering this much and that bitch walked me to slaughter almost. that stupdi therapist which the bedrijfarts referred me to said \"it is not possible thcange the label given by a manager\" and that it is better to have a PIP ina nother team.. she was putting words in my head and influencing outcomes.. wasn't even a good listener.
