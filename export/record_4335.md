And then we have limitless energy to the point it is free. One can surmise based on that that food is essentially limitlessly free. And the means to cook and eat and live is free. Not sure about medicine. Do you think at some point that too will experience a rugpull of cost and therefore becoming more accessible? I mean based on this reasoning.. \n\nNow would you agree with me the ability to create children is limited by the ability to provide for said children. If so then.. which is limited by what one is allowed to get in bijstand in netherlands and your ability to make money in other countries -  when such a world of near infinite sustenance becomes possible - what happens? population explosion? sustenance and ability to reproduce is defined by what one is able to deserve to provide for? i mean now. not in the hypothetical future. ?\n"
