Are negative experiences - traumas, or unideal situations that one had to live through and later 

Meaning - do people live through pro longed period of problems in terms of problematic relationships - ones where there is some dependency. Something like they are your family. But the harm becomes felt after leaving. For example after 27 years of living in a situation where those people can impact you. I am trying to ask if I can put down a long standing “normalised” relationship as a life ailment I was born with.

Is a relationship with a country also such a relationship. My life in India was mostly terrible. For example I had to work hard to get a high rank to get to a college. Then worked through difficult job interviews.

Help me understand this thinking:
I worked hard through teenage to get a high rank in AIEEE that of course he paid the college fee and also took me to the exam hall. But I studied. I demanded coaching classes without which I would not have made it. He resisted that and said I should study the books that I have. He had no words of appreciation or anything at all when the rank came out. But how on earth did he think he could tell some girl that 

Also go into the severity in comparison to the other things I’ve experienced. Who is the victim here? It appears that the girl’s parents too were forcing her to get married and she told me I will go study somewhere after marriage. It appears that this forcing toxicity was happening (ironically thankfully on both sides) she said yes to get her parents off her back. That was the toxicity that i was living through. I am forced to reckon that there is a larger trend of horrific Indian parents as a major societal hazard. Can I then say the aforementioned life ailment is actually Indian parenting. 

I cut contact with them when I left for the netherlands and only then did my mother change. Father is largely the same. Although he keeps his toxicity from coming out after seeing the impact. Even then sometimes he behaves disrespectfully. 

My working theory to define relationships is this: relationships are defined in terms of their harmfulness and otherwise through the actions that are done over a period of time. To determine if that relationship is harmful or not is determined over a period of time. Not in one interaction. If so that is the framework with which to analyse who is and is not actively harming us and who to keep a distance from. 

I am regretting or am in grief of things that occurred over a long period of time. I am not sure if it is making sense - I had a “family”. I had family interactions but most of it was harmful. The trauma if you can call it that existed for 27 years nearly. It was interwoven with good moments too - like me going to typing classes, etc. Not only was my own family harmful - most Indian families seem harmful as hell.  I may have been holding out hope against hope with respect to harmful people this whole time.

My thoughts seem all over the places. Please review our conversation and structure them into themes that make sense and also pull in details, events, themes, trends and evidence from earlier in the conversation,
