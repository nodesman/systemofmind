I am struggling to accept what made my parents behaviours as impactful for me. My brother i remember went similar to worse. Why is he not traumatically impacted? Also, please address this: are what i went through median indian familial toxicity. It seems about it. Perhaps it was impactful in me being impacted harder by it?
