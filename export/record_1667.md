So a more accurate turn of events is "I was driven out of work and then i wsa burnt out and then I pieced together bullying after having time to rest and then upon being asked by the HR person in february in the context of reintegrating around them again i told them no and why" - look all i am saying is i want to form a realistic understanding of what happened" the skill was applied where - in realizing what was going on? - sure i was driven out of work - 

I feel diminished by needing to take sick leave in the netherlands to be able to act on this - what would have happened in the usa or in india? which is what i worry about. then it looks like the sick leave is what helped me? having months of time to process and understand what happened? 

may be or may not i would have understood earlie with no let down effect but i was dealing with a lot. 

but was it really unique that with what we know i pieecd together what happened - i was force dout of the workplace right? isn't that why i had to answer hr? but the nature of the bullying itself lent itself to being a bit understood. the bringing up of performance issue in everything
