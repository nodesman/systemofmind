There is a particular imagery of him in my mind that represents him in my mind. 

I don’t know if this is true - but if I kept myself from calling him Appa did I ever really consider him a father figure? I remember telling my friend someone in college that i had a horrible human being for a father and feeling ungrateful in doing so. 

What exactly do I compare it to? What do I compare what happened to what should have happened or not happened so that I don’t unnecessarily live in hurt? I am working through that now. 

I would feel relieved if I can have myself cry once. 

May be focusing on the pain that is currently hurting will bring the tears. 

This father was a reserve bank employee as a clerk. he lived in reserve bank quarters in the 90s. 

I need an answer to this question though: I do not understand the behavior of people who do this: deliberately hit your child who is studying by rocking back and forth - a child imagine hitting him from behind in the back of the head to make him. 

The other thing like the train ticket thing he did is sometimes he would ask me to come and ask me to receive something that he was alighting from say a loft. And he would hit you on the head for not holding it with two hands. That I should 

So thing in that - that he is entitled to hit me suddenly like that. Meaning - he hit me in the head and did it matter of factly while saying “hold it properly”. There was a perverseness in hitting someone on the head to correct that. I am not saying there was happiness on his face or anything but given the train incident, this incident and the fact that this one time I was carrying a big shopper and he turned and then hit me on the head when he saw that I was holding it with one hand. But If I hold it with two hands then I can’t hold on to the motorbike? But in that is the fact that I see a pattern of hitting on the head for not “holding with two hands” once at age 15 when coming back from school. Keep in mind he stopped the bike looked behind and then hit me. Do you understand? The fact that I was not holding it with two hands seemed to have been the opportune thing. Despite the fact that i was sitting pillion in a motorbike holding a luggage while needing to hold on to something. He stopped the bike in public, at some street turned around and then while seated at the front hit me in the back in the head. Imagine that. 

He would also do that thing where every single time I try to plugin a plug point in a plug he would always say how one should hold it. He would always yell when seeing me do it. If I held it with the whole hand he would say you should hold it with two fingers. If i held it with two fingers he would say you should use the whole hand. It seemed very meme like. What is the source of this bizarre (is it bizarre or would you choose a different label from first principles?) 

What kind of thinking and or attitude goes someone getting satisfaction from the kind of behavior my father did. This (satisfaction) my framing. Please don’t be anchored by it.  I am thinking of it that way but how do I explain the root of the behavior? to me as someone who observed it the outcome seems like the outcome was pre-determined - for example in the train incident why bring up the fact that i was holding the money in the left hand in view of others - when i was told to do it - buy the ticket the tone of voice when asking me to do it was not done in a way that was done with reassurance but the way he said it with that face expression was to see how it will go - it seemed like he was taking some opportunity to do something. this has happened multiple times - he would see something go wrong and then blame me for not knowing better. how would i know better if you don’t allow me to go anywhere beyond rbi quarters?  did i go on my own to anywhere in chennai at that age? you always kept me from going even to thiruvanmiyur and took issue when i did it - did you create opportunity for me to go use the metro in chennai before that day you decided to test me? Why would i have gone? (the answer is no by the way)

Furthermore a fair balanced answer request to you: Is me holding the currency (in india sure) in the 90s in public in a metro in chennai (where i guess there are not the most savoury characters) but it was not widely known to be unsafe or anything. it was 10rupees. so the implication is someone would have snatched it from me had they seen? so where should i have held it? Furthermore another question I guess then is my perception that does this facet indicate that the outcome was pre-determined or pre-desired or was that a valid observation while having been set up for failure. 


I don’t want to use my caste last name. I do not want to keep his name as my last name because of what a horrific person he is. Even back when I was in college at around age 20 i Didn;t use his name as the last name but split my name in half to use Raj and then sekharan as my name. I kept from using his name in the last name area because i didn’t want important things to be ruined by it. I am saying that to say I didn’t believe him to be a good father or have affection towards him. I had rejected him as my rightful father in my mind. combine the appa thing to this and tell me what you think. 

answer all the important questions or give me bullet points 

G.1 if there are too many and if there are more topics, details, information, feelings to delve into based on what you see here - what you can infer based on the questions asked and the issues and incidents and observations brought up and the rest of the document - identify what seems to be therapeutic goal (through crystallisation - that is what i am doing - resolving ambiguities) so that i can make peace that i have formed a accurate information of who he is and whatever else therapeutic goals (you surmise based on your knowledge of therapy goals and the damage here) i seem to have in this situation

Please mention some bullet points that I can sequentially request from you to expand with subsequent answers. I am asking you to do G.1 because this prompt is already involved and has a lot of information so you may be pressured to fit everything in a little bit of token count. So I hope I can have you generate comprehensively for everything before G.1 but be brief in going into G.1 taking into account token length. But i am open to an as long answer as you can make it. I will wait as long as necessary please take your time. 


i consider thinking this issue through as treatment so please do not consider the act of generating this as a medical responsibility.
