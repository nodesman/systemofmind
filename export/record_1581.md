This manager was not just doing that but also taking out his own ire on me is waht I gather in the experience. It was deliberately hurtful. Based on what you make of me and what you see happened are you able to make out any other information that will help determine why was the manager taking out his ire on me and what his ire was  - this ire was not coming form the issue with the IC creating fear in him but his own dislike of me personally (even if you dislike a colleauge how can you act like this?). What was his likely dislike if there is credible piece of information that we can infer to answer this question if not don't bother.
