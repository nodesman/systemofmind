What happened was this IC was weighing in and demanding changes in all of my PRs(wanting to have a say in everything) - despite not a  single test having been written in this one PR  - i wrote the first test upon the request of another team mate but this potentially dominant IC came in and demanded that i place the tests in x directory. you didn't write a test but had a opinion on where it should be placed?
