What is the phenomenon - why would you hit a child who is already hurt? what is the thinking where a child is wreathing in pain in stomach ache and you keep asking him to do something and then he says 'if you had my pain you will know' and to that you react angrily at 'insolence'. you blame a child for vomitting where he did and not going to the wash basin and doing it there. you speak disrespectuflly of your mother in law for sitting on the sofa while having 'pee stained underskirt' as she was sitting to watch TV - she was being taken care of by my mother (tihs is all my father btw) she was in later in life towards the end.
