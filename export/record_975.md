We have to integrate the past into the present. One of the things in the past that's\nbothering me is the, yeah, I had to work up. So you say I have a duty, right? So which is what I kind of did. Not only, okay, I have a duty towards you, but you are\nalso hurting me. So in some ways, me leaving and running away is what helped me become who I am today. So it was necessary to move away from that environment in order\n to heal, in order to, ironically. so how do we make of the fact that i had to leave india in order to recover but i also did not get fluoxetine until i went back to thanjavur after signing an mta 1 year after naturalizaing here because of the failed dutch health care system and getting fluoxeting htere? \n"
