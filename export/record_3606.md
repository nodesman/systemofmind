For the money we pay inw ater tax we don;t get water, no justice in reasonable time, food in ration shops are bordering on inedible, there is anti-tamil sentiment in karnataka, anti-tamil sentiment existed in maharashtra, (am i making a leap to say we don't have national solidarity at all?) there was some advertisement in the orissa bjp election in 2024 making the point that (do you have a record of it if not tell me so, dont take me at my word for it) you dont want your state run by a tamil. why make that ad - was there anti-tamil sentiment in orissa? does it feel like we have a national solidarity? \n\nbritish officers served in the indian army after \"freedom\"? what kind of freedom was it where the one who we got freedom from has a statue of the guy who got freedom for us on the oppressors' parliament? what kind of freedom fighter offers troops - blood to british empire to fight their wars? what kind of a freeom fighter asks revolt to put down their arms?\n"
