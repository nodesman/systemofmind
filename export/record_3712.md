Did the AIEEE tournament affect me? I didn't like how one of the companies treated me for sure. \n\nAfter leaving my parents home I definitley lived in India and felt it unbearable and the wall closing on me. Like I had to take the first exit out and succeeded in doing it. I did feel like I had to put my life on hold and put my dreams of enterpising my ideas on hold and focus on emigration. Does that look like a sign that I was traumatized by India or that i just hated being in India. I would not say I ws actively every waking moment in pain but did feel a strong need to leave India back then. \n\nWhat do you think? It was not my thinking back in 2014 that my parents provided for everything and therefore it was an extractive system. I was unhappy about what I as an adult experienced in temrs of adult like - i hit peak very quickly in tersm of living standards. Further up was pointless.  And I did feel the parasitic tendency of my money being spent on \n\nEeryday interactions did hurt me. I became more onguard and aware of how people can screw me over and got good at preempting and preventing it in India by the time I was 29. It sitll happened from tiem to tiem. \n\nBut I got better. I felt better not having to do it as much here. \n\nWhat I am hoping to do here is a cohesive and realistic perspective of what is the source of my let down effect: my parental behavior and the forced arranged marriage all pointing to my father's behavior and borhter's behavior. What else? how much of an impact was India as a whole? I did like wokring in my last 2 emplyers people were nice. What else? Th elet down effect was partially the divorce and the horrible sitaution with my aprents and the arranged marriage trauma. The manner in wihch my wife treated me it seems was also not ideal. Whil i enjoyd some of it it quickly wen down hill with her being a needy walkin on egg shells situation. The zeitgesit of indian inter0gender contact was one of you have to improve standing to earn a decent girl and then you have to be a rpovider and emotional fluffer of all her needs and wishes. \n\nI did experience traffic incidents. Someoen hit me while in traffic. Someone pushed me out of an ATM in 2011 when i stood my ground with taking my time with teh ATM.\n\nI didnt like everyday interactions where someone would take yoru change and not give lose change for what you bought and just pocket it. I found it annoying that it happened again in 2025 when I went to India just now.  \n\nWhat do you think ? Was I impacted by Indian systemic dysfunctions\n\nIs the answer not clear and you want to ask me piercing corss cutting questions and I should answer them to determine the answer? Or do you know engouh alredy? \n"
