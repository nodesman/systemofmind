(it makes so much sense but.. how can i trust you ? that this is the truth of how hinduism came to be? you may say that is a question for me to struggle with.. but yes it all makes so much sense.. mrugan is a south indian tamil god which north indians hardly talk about.. so.. and most of the gods in the south are shiva temples and amman temples so it is making sense.. it fits.. do people continue bcasue it provides benefits? in hindusim? or becuase they dont know that it was  form of generational narrative control?\n"
