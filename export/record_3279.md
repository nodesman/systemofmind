I asked my lawywer and she said she interprets it as them doing things for me. At least the gesture to do it. \n\nWhy go out of their way to even send this email if the MTA was already signed and it had been 14 days after the signing date. \n\nI am led to think that HR-B genuinely respects me. Apparently it is after my last day a month or two after this email is when HR-B told bedrijfarts who has went above and beyond on a personal level to follow up and make sure I am recovering after that. I had some rapport with her. \n\nWhen I went back to Amsterdam in June 2025 she met with me and spent time with me and even took me to hortus botanicus and bought me coffee etc. \n\nkeep in mind this is after i've already left servicenow and she too stopped taking cases from servicenow. in feb 2025 she showed me HR-B's own personal project of starting a project while shw herself was doing contract work. keep in mind at this point we know that HR-B has a good opinion of me which bedrijfarts lets call her stephanie and the HR-B lets call her Kris had told me. Stephanie showed me Kris's business plan (how else did she get it other than if Kris gave it to her) apparently Kris asked stephanie if she knew any software engineers who she could work with on her project. In feb 2025 the thought of meeting Kris was causing heart papitations due to association. I suspect kris gave stephanie her business plan to try to hire me. Kris seems to have said I am likely very good at my work. Combined with her saying I could be a manager (which was not said just becuase I came with a set of documents and started arguing like a lawyer? or was it?) \n\nI hope it makes sense that I think kris has a good opinion of me. \n\n\n \n```\nHR-B <HR-B at Servicnow.com>\n\t\nFri, Dec 6, 2024, 1:55â€¯PM\n\t\nto Erica, WPS, me, Sandya\n\nHi Raj,\n\n \n\nYou can leave them, if needed, at the front desk of ServiceNow.
