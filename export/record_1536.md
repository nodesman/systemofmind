But I did accept it that day though. I already went through 3 rounds of negotiations. Do I think I would have asked for more. May be not. May be. What do you think? Was there impact? Do I feel lacking at saying yes? No. Did I change my mind after the day R was received? They acknowledged my "acceptance"on the R day.
