Please make a comprehensive review of the conversation and give me a break down of what happened. How I navigated it. What I should have done differently or learn from this. Your review of the outcome including the negotiating. Give me as elaborate and come up with more facets of break downs you can come up with that have not already been discussed but sound like will be of interest to me based on everything I've said. Give me also carefully selected words of empathetic support. Give me evidence of what I can improve ( what some may say I did wrong)
