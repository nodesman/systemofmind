Emotional Reciprocity	Measures whether both people invest emotionally in the relationship. If one person consistently gives more and the other does not reciprocate, it creates resentment and emotional exhaustion.	✅ Mutual / ⚠️ Unequal / 🚨 One-sided
Effort Balance	Determines whether both individuals make an effort to maintain the relationship. Ideally, effort should be reciprocal and natural, not forced or one-sided.	✅ Balanced / ⚠️ Slightly Uneven / 🚨 Draining
Power & Status Dynamics	Assesses whether one person has significantly more control, influence, or authority in the relationship. Power is not always bad, but it can lead to dependency or exploitation if unbalanced.	✅ Equal / ⚠️ Mild Hierarchy / 🚨 Exploited Power
Fear-Based Control	Examines whether fear, guilt, or coercion is used to maintain the relationship. Healthy relationships are built on trust, not emotional blackmail or manipulation.	✅ None / ⚠️ Some Guilt-Tripping / 🚨 High Control
Respect for Boundaries	Determines if personal space, autonomy, and limits are respected. If one person frequently disregards boundaries, it leads to discomfort and loss of agency.	✅ Respected / ⚠️ Occasionally Ignored / 🚨 Disrespected
Emotional Replenishment	Evaluates whether the relationship brings emotional energy and fulfillment or leaves one feeling drained and exhausted. A healthy relationship should enhance well-being, not deplete it.	🔋 Energizing / 🔄 Neutral / ⛽ Draining
Conflict Resolution Style	Examines how conflicts and disagreements are handled. A strong relationship has open discussions and resolution, while a weak one has blame, avoidance, or aggression.	✅ Healthy / ⚠️ Avoidant / 🚨 Toxic
Shared Purpose & Alignment	Checks if both individuals have compatible long-term values, goals, and expectations. If misaligned, the relationship may not be sustainable.	✅ Aligned / ⚠️ Partially Aligned / 🚨 Mismatched
Adaptability to Change	Determines if the relationship can evolve with changing circumstances. Stagnant or rigid relationships break under pressure, while adaptable ones survive and grow.	✅ Highly Adaptable / ⚠️ Struggles to Adapt / 🚨 Rigid
Mutual Acceptance of Asymmetry	If there is an imbalance of power, assesses whether both parties accept it or if there is underlying resentment. Some relationships function with asymmetry if both people agree to it.	✅ Accepted & Stable / ⚠️ Unclear / 🚨 Resentment Present
Cultural Norm Adjustment	Evaluates whether power structures, expectations, and norms align with cultural context. Certain hierarchies are acceptable within specific cultures but problematic in others.	🌍 Expected & Healthy / ⚠️ Misaligned / 🚨 Problematic
Functional vs. Fulfilling	Differentiates between relationships that are both functional and fulfilling versus those that are only functional (transactional) or neither.	✅ Both Functional & Fulfilling / ⚠️ Functional But Unfulfilling / 🚨 Neither Functional Nor Fulfilling
Trajectory Over Time	Tracks whether the relationship is improving, stagnant, or declining. The direction over time is often more important than the current state.	📈 Improving / 🔄 Stagnant / 📉 Declining
