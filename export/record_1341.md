The zietgeist has changed? \n\nIt looks like I wanted to be in the scoeity that is known for greatness and reaching for excellence in all areas of life.. i used to see that show extreme machines and how that budweiser people broke land speed records in the utah salt flats.. and how they did that x-wing aircraft back in the 60s or 50s ffs. And they made SR71 black bird back in the 60s!!! insane. and they were all paid a salary and ont used like slave labour or anything\n\nI do have a qeustion why cant there be pursuit of excellence while also having a good social net like in the Netherlands? \n"
