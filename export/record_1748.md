  - Next time when something like that is said you keep your

- What can we learn?

  - What gaslighting looks like

    - For a moment we even thought may be we are the ones who are holding on to unnecessary resentment and said we have to stop being cyncial and gave the chance. I feel like I failed here. I was asked to let it go but I quickly realized that i was being made to deny my own reality because what happend after that was more of the same so I soon after realized I was not being cynical.

      - What was that? Why did that momentary "concession"

        - That seemed like mometary fatigue after a long period of unethical behavior?

          - It was a product of more of the same from ðŸ¦Š


This happened at the workplace in a software engineering team and the individual concerned was obstructing my PRs. This is my analysis - I need a more balanced view. Even a frank one 

Why do you based on our understanding of all that happened do you surmise I momentarily "conceded" ? Do no necessarily use my framing for why - try to come up with your understanding of why it happened
