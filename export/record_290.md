Saying so and so things were done. I mean to ask this in general - what is that thing - where they seem to have an agency and agenda that doesn’t take your needs and wants into account (such as hitting me when I am asleep and forcing me to come with him to get pills from doctor) booking flight tickets and then telling me while I am employed becuase he needed to get things done. I don’t mean to ask about my father but that interface - having to be around them seems irritating -someone who is so self-serving. "
