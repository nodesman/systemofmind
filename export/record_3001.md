  "content": "Gemini, the regret still is that I did not fully articualte everything about how they failed me and take them to the court and destroy them. May be articulating it to you will hepl at least be understood. But Even that is just reading text. But you know that I had far mre leverage than â‚¬50k. It feels like a failure or a tragedy. It feels like something I should have been able to do but i was not because of how i was failed by the dutch health care system. I put in monumental efforts to try and recover sooner - spared no expense went to two different haptotherapist. Only thing I didn't do was take the steraline tablet i fought for but was not enoucarged to follow through on (saying this makes me feel like i am blaming someone but i did not feel confident taking it even though i felt a bit better after starting to take it.. that shitty dw documentary  (btw, having seen that dw documentary and being influenced by it that led to this outcome - what is the lesson from this?) about antidepressants and painting it like people are dependent on them was the singular thing that broke me. I took every effort - going out at every opportunity, doing breathing exercises, eating on time, while all that may have been \"good long term\" but i needed short term recovery from nearly being pushed into losing the will to live levelso f harasssment. who else to blame other than the dutch health care system for this. why should i not take my time in the ziektewet to pull yself back up.. that not foring their hand and pushign that HR-B's hand into acting against donkey feels like something i should have been able to do. this is the kind of thing that they did in booking - made me feel unwelcome in order to discouarge me from reintegrating...isnt' that constructive dismissal (in booking's case do i have the opotion of takign tehm to court for constructive dismissla for lying about performance problems and coercing me into signing an mta with a liability clauyse?
