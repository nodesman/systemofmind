A place with brilliant project managers, no \"shit managers,\" no \"idiots,\" where PRs are reviewed rigorously, technical debt is always paid down, and the entire organization moves with the clean, logical precision of a well-designed algorithm?\n>\n> **B) The \"Impact & Scale\" Fantasy:** Are you imagining a world where your work is on a product with a billion users? A place where the technical problems are so massive and so fundamental (e.g., designing a new global-scale database at Google) that solving them gives you a sense of profound, world-changing impact and places you at the absolute center of the tech universe?\n\n\nI had an opportunity to think about process purity and I don't want to have look I don't like your wording of calling it process purity fantasy yeah I mean why would I know should I not expect bad no shit managers PRs are reviewed carefully there is a decency in how the people behave in the PR there is open discussion about how what needs to be done it's clear open discussion about issues in retrospective PRs are reviewed rigorously I mean you should do you know I should have some decency in how you behave in pull requests why is that too wrong yeah I mean there should be called there should be a bar for how someone if someone is made an architect they are supposed to show a certain degree of behavior and decency you can't behave like a piece of shit and then get get promoted to being an architect impact and scale fantasy is not something that I okay I would like to be able to influence the product but I also do not want to become a product manager or anything I would like to work on more recent technology nothing proprietary and what else no yeah so when someone is promoted they are not promoted despite their bad behavior their bad behavior is addressed as a precondition of promotion\n"
