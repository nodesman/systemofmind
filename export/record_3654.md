  "content": "The Calculus for \"India\" (as a political entity and the Hindi Belt's cultural project):\nCategory \tAnalysis \tNet Score\n1. Civilizational Respect \tYou see the dominant \"Indian\" narrative as one of cultural hegemony that disrespects and devalues your own civilization. The \"high ideals\" are often, in your view, hypocritical. \tStrongly Negative (-- )\n2. Interpersonal Respect \tWhile you can have good individual relationships, your experience of the systemic interpersonal dynamic is one of being an \"other\" (e.g., anti-Tamil sentiment). \tNegative (-)\n3. Civic Reciprocity \tThe federal system is structurally extractive, taking a disproportionate share of your state's wealth to fund a system that often works against your interests. \tStrongly Negative (-- )\n4. Cultural Reciprocity \tThe dominant \"Indian\" culture does not nourish you. In fact, you see it as a source of values and behaviors you actively dislike and reject. \tNegative (-)\nOverall Net Value \tCatastrophically Negative. The \"Indian\" system, in your analysis, fails you on every single metric. It fails the respect test at both the civilizational and interpersonal levels, and it fails the reciprocity test at both the civic and cultural levels. There is no redeeming positive to balance the ledger.\n\nYou have mentioned civilizational respect for India as one of how most Indian narrartive is not respectful of India \n\na) becuase of hindi belt,  karnataka, maharashtra? \nb) is that the right way to approach it in terms of equivalence to how you did Tamil civilizational respect \"You feel a deep pride in and respect for the ideals and achievements of Tamil civilization (Kural, Cholas, language).\" \n\nc ) Or was the way you approached civilizational respect wrong - one is about how other party is respecting you and this one is about how while inside the culture do you feel respect. Meaning is the correct way to approach it then Am i proud to of Indian culture - \n\nI guess in the Tamil context Tamils are not goign to be disrespectful to other Tamils right for being Tamil. \nDoes it mean other Indians are disrespectful to other Indians? (they can be for beign Indian by the way) \nHow exactly do we define or in the original context did we approach defining civilizational respect? What is the framing of the question that gives the answer of positive or negative. We can of course not generalize but there is a greater than 50% chance of it beign a certain way?\n\nCivilizational respect is i guess are other cultures treating Tamil culture with respect? Right? That is what makes sense or is it \n\nCivilizational respect from tamils to tamils is a moot point becuase we are proud to be tamil and we respect tamil culture and i am not betrayed by other tamils in defence of tamil culture.  \n\nIs the Indian project only a product of the Hindi belt and should be seen like that as if we are all the rest of us stallited and dominions? You can impolitely say yes if you want its ifne if it is true.  \n"
