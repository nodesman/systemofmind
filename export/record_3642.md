Is that what a surinam or ABCD do? It looks like they are starting to do that. \n\na) I am not going to become something else like Asian or something. I don't want to say I want to become white or something. That is not what I want. I don't want to be Indian but can you be brown without being Indian is the question. I am not ashamed of the way I look. I like it and I put in a lot of effort. \nb) What would a person of indian heritage do while not existing in India - is there a problem of how Indians are placed in the world - do we want to assert our place and get the respect we deserve everywehere - do we not already do that? not entirely. but unlike other demographis we are fighting valorusouly head on - i find that asian cultures are not owning their culture and instead of distancing themselves from a chinese or other identity and trying to ape white americans. black people have a chip on their shoulder i am so soorry.. but they do. there is no moderation in them. they;re always insecure. arabs also sometimes bottom feed or do the same racism for some reason - payig white people more than indians for the same job. not sure if it happes but whatever i heard of it.  \n"
