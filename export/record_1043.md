So is this something I need to manage? Does life look like an act of constant travel?\n\nMaybe I’ll make a lot of money and then travel, but at the base… Okay, we’ve established I’m not going to live in the US or in India. Does that mean I’m not going to live anywhere else in Europe?\n\nA temporary move may be possible, but a permanent move may not be. I’m not sure. What do you think?\n\nBecause why would I move? Italy has lower income. Spain has lower income. Weather is better, for sure. In Spain—maybe Spain—if I’m financially free, I can go to Spain.\n\nEven my parents didn’t always live in one place they lived in Chennai from 1981 to 1999 then moved to hyderabad for 5 years where I spent my teenage, then I moved to vellore and they moved to Chennai, then they moved to mumbai and I moved to hyderabad. Then they moved back to Chennai and then retired and then to thanjavur and I moved to Chennai for work. \n\nThe idea of a permanent future in one place a) Is it necessary - becuase what if I will at some point be in old age? Meaning is it necessary for a person to be in one place and live in that city throughout their life. I mean sure someone can have a salary man job  What does one have to do in this respect so that one is not negatively impacting ones own life in the long term?  b) \n\nI’ll tell you what came across my mind. I was waking to Albert hiejn from my home where I lived and bought the house. I was wondering if this is the routine for the next 70 years for me? As against? \n\nI was going to live somewhere. If I had lived in Daniel stalpertstraat and bought a house there? \n\nWhy am I having this thought of being surprised this is where I am going to be or this is the routine for me. We already established that this is the best life one can have above and beyond most places in the world. So what appears to be the problem in terms of accepting that Amsterdam is where you will live. What seems to be happeneing in your perspective. What do you see in my words? When I think of me doing this routine for a long time I fear I became like that loser neighbor who is this surinam subhuman filth. So what if I am like that subhuman filth guy? \n\nThere is a slight fear of if this is it then this is life. A fear of a boring routine. That seems scary. 50-60 more years of it. May be it will help to do those things while wearing a headphone and listening to podcasts and videos so that it still feels exciting. \n\nI am afraid also of “is this it?” But then if this is not it then what? You want to work towards having a mansion? This thought came up as I typed the above and then asked so what? Not the visceral actual thoughts I felt. \n\nAnother fear is this is the top? But my top is Amsterdam - I live in Amsterdam proper and that is something to value a lot. It is not nothing. People in the USA and elsewhere can only dream of this kind of life. They live in suburban hole. How are the lives of people in UK and in other Western Europe and Mediterranean cities? Sure some of them ar good. Some neighbourhoods in Italy Spain are surely great. May be even in Praha. This cozy comfy low effort way to get food. Not as much. Not as common in a larger supportive system. \n\nI do look outside and see that the look and feel of the surroundings in amsterdam Oost is not Zurich level polished. So that sometimes hits me viscerally. \n\nSo what do you see in all this?\n\n"
