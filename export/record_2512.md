  "content": "Which then means when things are being said about you you ahve to look at the data - you can’t just say random things and give performance issues. You ahve to drill it down to data of instances and metrics or your performance thing is rejected. If you don’t correct it my lawyer will be involved. But when I wrote this I imagined myself futilely having to do this while being placed on PIP while in Uber while some manager acting like I was a lost cause and it is too far and me being too different from it? Like I am as an engineer too little to be worthy of Uber? And me saying this like an idealist to the manager - sure you can place me on a PIP but make sure your metrics for success are objective. They will do something to try to fire you by HR right by making you take MTA? Treat you badly in order to get rid of you or torture you like this. Is this my trauma talking or can it just happen? I feel insecure about it potentially happening having endured sick leave and twice and may be I didnt step up to the plate in Uber? This is all an ideal scenario by the way... not even like something that happened. But see what my mind is going to. From the lesson I am learning like I would end up in a losing battle asking for clear metrics and “fight against the tide” when a manager is trying to get rid of me. By inviting that I stay in Uber when the others in the team are likely trying to push me out and treat me lesser and may be the manger is doing it because my other team mate found me insufficient? Not good enough? What is the right thing to do even there supposing this happens? Just leave? Uber seems to expect high performance but what does that even mean? Am I going to fail there not knowing the answer already? Will there be good managers who will help me succeed there? why even have dutch labor laws and work there if Uber can force me out like that? After having cleared the interview? What does it say about me or why my mind is going there? "
