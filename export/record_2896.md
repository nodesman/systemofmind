  "content": "The part that i am not able to get over is the behavior i witnessed where he felt entitled to take his anger out on me - how can you feel entitled to behave angrily and retaliate against someone? did he not know he was doing something wrong and sometihng that can gethim fired if not that it is unethical and wrong to do that to someone? so an otherwise spineless individual - is it only these individuals that are dangerous. but then what sign would there have been. i should have had many managers in the past right? i have had only non existent to bad ones.. mostly. Someone told me this: ```There are four types of people: (1) Incompetent and malevolent — obvious and short-lived; (2) Incompetent but well-intentioned — dangerous because they cause damage while believing they’re helping; (3) Competent looters — skilled, ruthless, and corrosive over time; (4) Marketing grifters — competent at manipulation, often allied with or disguised as 3. Types 2 and 3 are the most harmful: 2 drags things down slowly under the guise of virtue, while 3 bends the system for personal gain. They justify endlessly, and can operate for years. Type 1 is easy to spot. Type 2 and borderline personalities often blur into each other — they believe they’re doing good but can become destructive. Type 3 and 4 can blend as well — both calculating, but 4 wears th mask of progress.``` - does buffalo fit any of this pattern at all? "
