I lived in multiple places I realized this is shit. I've seen what the upper limit of life in India can look like. The cost of the hedging of this how to see it did I take the right calls when I okay first I tried to go to the US but my F1 visa was rejected then I fell back to try to apply to Germany then I hit the Netherlands at the time before COVID the opportunities were nice so I applied got it came here to booking endured the bullshit. I survived the four to five years of life and then I made it. The one thing that concerns me is did I choose to come to the Netherlands? See I left India and moved here right and then I came here and then I stayed here. Is it correct to say I because I stayed here I chose to come here chose to come here? Did I fully think things through? The thing is this is a Western European country I did expect that the rules and systems would be working very well which was largely true. Okay I had a lot of support that helped me succeed here but the two workplaces that I worked in were terrible but I somehow survived and I naturalized and I am now on support. My only concern is the concern I have is am I acting from a place of agency because if I'm also having the I'm also having the dilemma of if I should let go of India if I should let go of the USA while also thinking about if I chose the Netherlands or not why does it matter if I chose it or not it is the best option. The fact that I did not choose to get it but came here because it was the best option but it turned out to be the best of all of them. Well okay my disappointment is it was not the best uh I did not foresee that it was the absolute best option of all options and that is my disappointment that I did not do choose the app. I have the best thing now but it is not the absolute best of all options for immigration from India and that is my disappointment. This is a very odd thing.\n"
