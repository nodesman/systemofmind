You feel pressure because you are not generating these specific signals.\n>\n> Let's analyze the *actual substance* behind these signals. Which of these two statements feels more true to you, based on your own deep analysis and life experience?\n>\n> **A) These signals are a genuine and reliable indicator of a superior, more fulfilling, and happier life.** The people posting these things have truly \"won,\" and their lives are objectively better than mine.\n>\n> **B) These signals are a form of \"performative success\" in a very narrow and often misleading game.** They are the highlight reel, designed to generate envy and status, but they often hide the immense, unstated costs (the green card trap, the lack of a safety net, the burnout culture, the personal precarity). The \"winners\" of this game are often just well-compensated players in a different kind of gilded cage.\n\n\nI dont know if their life is objectively better than mind in every way. I tihnk they probably rub shoulders with and have the ability to run shoulders with very smart people in SF. Which is something. \n\nBut keep in mind this french person posted this and sounds quiet bad even for a french person :\n\n```\nMoving to SF/US is amazing for your career, but it comes with real family sacrifices.\n\nI know so many founders (myself included) who moved thousands of miles and only saw family once a year. During Covid, not at all.\n\nI saw my grandparents 5 times in 15 years. They passed one by one. I couldn’t even attend my grandma’s funeral, stuck between visas.\n\nNow with kids, they barely know their grandparents. Traveling with 5 people now is really challenging and paying for an extra guest bed room isn’t easy for everyone. \n\nI know many of you live this too. Nobody talks about it, this is not easy and gets really painful when the years go by.\n\n```\n\nIt is performative success I would say - the chosing to play it in the big league designed to generate envy and status. I don't knwo if the other people doing it are doing it for performative reasons but if I were to pursuie it will be mostly for that. I can't see myself be that academically inclined. \n"
