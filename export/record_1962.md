  "content": "My question si far more about in terms of what people go through in life is just we just go from jobs to jobs. But I guess you can do something creative with your finances, get lucky somehow and become financially free too and pay off your house. So I grew up and then I felt like I wanted to have everything life had to offer so I resisted wanting to settle down so quickly. Why I bring it up is that this whole experience of what I’ve been through and this thing at work that I went through - it made me frustrated to feel that I lost a lot. So what is a balanced way to approach the “loss” meaning I just have to find another job and succeed in it right? What is the balanced way to see this? Even people who are in my position who become independent - what can you do - it’s not like I can pull million bucks out of my butt. I have to find another job. This is real life.  Some more information. I moved to Netherlands in 2017. I was forced to leave booking in 2020 march. Then I found the job in servicenow in 2020 April and then joined in June 2020 and then the blackmail and taunting and Ic  problem happened in June 2023. Just so you know. "
