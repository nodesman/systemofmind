They are “portfolio” societies. * Multiple Paths to Success: There isn’t one single exam that determines your fate. Success can be achieved through university, vocational training, entrepreneurship, the arts, or skilled trades. * High Safety Net: Failure is not catastrophic. If you try to start a business and it fails, you don’t end up destitute. You get unemployment benefits and can try again. * Emphasis on “Soft” and “Meta” Skills: Success is often determined not just by technical knowledge, but by creativity, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and adaptability. When you apply the “tiger parent” tournament strategy to a “portfolio” society, you create a massive mismatch. * You are training a sprinter for a marathon. You are optimizing for one short, intense race, but life here is a long game that requires a different set of skills. * You are giving them a hammer when they will need a whole toolbox. Rote memorization and exam-taking prowess are just one tool. They will be competing with peers who have been trained in teamwork, public speaking, creative problem-solving, and emotional intelligence.``` then that too seems out of place with what happened to me?
