This is going to sound odd, but I endured severe torturous pain one month after my sick leave. Not knowing if there is actually a PIP for this. So this guy interviewed conflicting statements. So not only was I not able to function at work because he found issue with everything I did, but also I didn't know if I was going to lose my job or my health was in bad condition. I was in torturous amount of pain one month after this and yet I don't know how to see the fact that he got fired. I think there is something wrong with me where I ended up getting him fired. I mean there is something wrong with me because I mean something wrong with me in the sense for me feeling bad about it, but he deserved it. But I am not yet, you know this idea that someone did something to me, really really bad, nearly ended my life. And I am still not able to see it. There is something wrong. I need to fix this.
