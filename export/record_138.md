One time some teacher told me that you need to have a, I mean I'm not giving the giving the mark sheets to him apparently because I'm afraid of him and they advised him to go take my take me to somewhere and show me a good time. He took me to some Hyderabad park and then three days later he blamed me for holding on to some mark sheet which I did because I didn't trust him because he took me to a park once. Basically taking him to the park was supposed to make me feel comfortable in giving him the mark sheet so that I basically whenever I give the mark sheet he'll always be beating or some humiliation for days and weeks and months. So I live in hell. I lived in hell at home and it was also difficult in school. So I mean it was not that bad but it's okay there's some shaming and things. Happening at school but it's fine but at home if I have to take mark sheets and he would see it if it's not a good grade he would still talk say mention it again and again for weeks weeks and months. He had no, you didn't have standing to get marks but you want dental appointment. He tied my dental appointment to getting grades.
