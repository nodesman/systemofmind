I was suspended from college for doing something, forget about what it was, but I was suspended and then I repeated a year and I graduated in 2009. Okay, what would have happened if I directly went to college again? I mean the circumstances that led to my being debarred? Could it have not happened? Lack of restraint, I guess. Okay, then I don't know, fine. So sometimes some people just go straight from UG to PG, like meaning do MS and then get good scores and leave immediately to do MS in USA. I mean let's say after that I went to work in some Silicon Valley company. What is the optimistic timeline for when I would have gotten an H1B without being debarred? I was originally supposed to graduate in 2008.
