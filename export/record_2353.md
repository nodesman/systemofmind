When the divorce was happening, a girl showed interest in me. I couldn't take it forward because it was in the middle of the divorce. And it was going to go 50-50. They were trying to put the marriage back together. And I was beating myself up for years for not showing any interest or taking that to the next level. I was also in a new country, new context. And I didn't know how to traverse, I guess, how to interact with women. Especially when one of them is showing interest in you. What is the right level of right behavior? The one thing that seemed to break the mold of me being seen as some black... I mean, there were things I didn't say that seemed to set me up to look different. I used to color my hair brown and that made me look different from a demographic that women avoid in Amsterdam. It changed how they treated me. This incident with the divorce with the girl showing interest in me was back in 2019. I had been living in trauma after trauma and that has been painful that so much opportunity was lost. "
