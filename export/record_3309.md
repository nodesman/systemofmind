They should show technical mettle right? \n\nWould someone being made an architect be a suprise to people in the team?\n\nIf this individual has architect title then how do they succeed without the skills? if thee is no one of architect ability then what happens? Without architect support how will the team succeed? I was trying to do my work as a engineer and i was asking professional questions and he was \"not up for discussion\". So what was goign on? What do you think is likely goign ot happen down the road in one of the retrospectives? \n\nWhy force someone to attend a retrospective meeting because they are being paid for it?\n\nWith this context how would they have experienced the investigation and the outcome? \n\nDoes this give you an idnication of why this whole thing happened? \n"
