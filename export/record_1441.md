  "content": "- Imagine yourself at 80 years old, looking back on your life from this point forward. What would a life well-lived look like? What accomplishments or experiences would bring you the deepest sense of pride and satisfaction, and what would you most regret not having done?\n  - I will have raised a few children. I will have bought a house in Thailand, paid off the Amsterdam home and retired.\n  - I will have broadly figured the relationship situation\n    - Such as taken my best shot \n      - Carefully weighed my options and picked a rewarding relationship with a good girl.\n        - What is the point of life without a rewarding loving relationship. One that salves the soul. \n  - Traveled much of the world and seen and had varied experiences. \n  - Used my varied experiences and unique perspective to have broad impact through writing and creative new projects. \n  - Raised my children well. Meaning, done my best for their well being. \n  - I would have also looked good - dressed well, and taken good care of my body so that I was always great looking all through my life. \n- The Pattaya goal represents a different kind of life. What specific freedoms or feelings do you believe that life would provide that your current path does not? Is it an escape from responsibility, a reward for your hard work, a search for simplicity, or something else entirely?\n  - Better weather, living in Thailand which I love. I love living in Thailand. It is a reward for my hard work. Away from the chaos and stress of life. Nice Asian life around nice Thai people.\n\n# We've discussed the \"mythical soldier\" as an internal narrative of resilience. When do you first remember this part of yourself forming, and in response to what circumstances? More importantly, what is the emotional cost of constantly being the \"soldier\"? What does vulnerability look like to you, and is it something you see as a weakness, a necessity, or both?\n\nI think it was just a coping mechanism for the fact that I had to live through so much pain and suffering and I steeled myself to so much pain. I don’t identify with that anymore. I don’t define myself by endurance. Vulnerability is a necessity and I have courage to do more than many but I have learnt to be aware in which situations one is vulnerable. No point being vulnerable among shrarks and hyenas. \n\n\n# You have ideas for ambitious creative projects like \"Timeline\" and generative art. How does the feeling of working on these creative prototypes differ from the feeling of solving a complex engineering problem at work? Does one provide a type of nourishment or satisfaction that the other doesn't? Is this a hobby, or an unfulfilled part of your core identity?\n\nYes I hardly ever solve a business problem I relate to. Work is in someone else’s business. I don’t relate to the satisfaction of selling more hotels. Work is means to an end. Sometimes it is fulfilling. But may be that s how it was in the past and can be different in the future. I can apply myself better in the future. I turn to these projects because I get fulfilment in expression (unfulfilled part of core identity as you put it) and applying my ideas in ways that I have full autonomy on. \n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nI also seem to have a conflicting goal or self image of wanting to also be someone like jeff bezos and be rich. May be that was a coping mechanism for self esteem that I need to overcome. It is a coping mechanism. If I die ithout reaching a height like that it feelsl ike I failed hard. I died having failed. If I did not get the porsche, the etihad apartment flight ticket, fly first class, drive a porsche. etc\n"
