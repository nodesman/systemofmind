Sense of justice for me is not treating him like a family member at age 38 and his age is 67 or something. He was born in 1956 and right now is 2025, so whatever my age that is. So, I'm not going to treat him, what to say, appropriate narrative of healing. He's not going to apologize for or admit that he was wrong. He's the same guy. He was mostly the same person today. Okay, so what is a useful narrative and protocol for me to adopt today so that I can say that I am doing the right thing morally in how I treat him.
