The doctor's report indicated that there was a problem int he workplace and the HR got in touch with this guy and lined up a meeting for next steps. What do you think he thought - that he knew he was part of the problem? This doctor's report came out on August 17. The bullying and blackmail went on from June 21 to July 21. The conversation was lined up by HR on September 3 for Sept 12. I responded on september 3 that he is one of two problems. But before then HR and the manager seemed to alerady have coordinated having to have a meeting. At this point I mean to ask what did he think. Specifically before I told the HR person that he is one of the problems?
