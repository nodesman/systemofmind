So knowing that um look the when the bullying was going on at one point I tried to get in touch with this manager's manager okay within 45 minutes this manager pinged me. I pinged this Marco pinged this director which is this manager's manager I asked I said I want to talk to you about an RFC and then he for some reason pinged and asked what is it about and then the whole interaction left me feeling whether objectively or not that he was trying to avoid interacting with me and after I pinged this guy 45 minutes later this manager pinged me and asked how are things going which he rarely does I'm not sure okay you don't don't believe me but it looks to me like the the man the director seems to be knowing what was going on okay upon the first after this after I went on sick leave and asked after I told HR that this manager is one of two people problem I asked to speak to HR and the director at which point his director said for some reason he said that they are working on this project that this IC is working on is so important that he was told to not fail at it almost it made me feel like I'm supposed to think that is the reason why he took I mean it seemed like that one he gave this manager backing to do these unethical things in order to somehow make sure nothing goes wrong and he did this looks like he knew it because that guy was under pressure he did this and he had the backing of the director okay that's what it looks like this is further corroborated by the fact that what triggered him to report my LinkedIn post because it was the director and the HR who are in that meeting where I reported him for bullying what how did he know he was reported for bullying until then he was not reported right because in October and the HR my first HR meeting happened in August in October he reported my LinkedIn post for doing business taking a aggressive action trying to discredit me he must have been alarmed by something furthermore when he was finally so-called retired the sending of an email looked like a a hero was leaving a hero I mean the email sent by this by this director what I'm trying to say is it looks like they all were all in on it from what I went through because of their so-called pressure. If a director knew that a manager was managed out for unprofessional reasons then would he get a glowing goodbye. 

If I was always trying to be helpful why would you do something like this to someone who is an employee? 

Now give me a revised:

I'm open to a devil's advocate to ensure I'm not leading you. Or a more balanced answer. Let me know. 

Is there perception that he became a unfortunate casualty in his pressure? If you were competent then you won't have faced the right? So you were under pressure so this happened? Someone who was under pressure would have attended meetings.  So you pressure means I have to accept this loss? How can you after the investigation with a straight face hold me in resentment for what happened because I was being found at fault for ordinary interactions by this manager. This directly seems to have said it's okay if you have to give him an MTA. After he was part of the problem he was trying to prevent my return? There's a lot of unconfirmed details in the and only inferences. But what do you think? Give me a balanced answer.
