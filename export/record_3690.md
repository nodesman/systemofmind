And now he was not a annoyance but a debilitating problem. one that caused hurt. \n\nWhat do i do about his death? when he gets ill?\n\nIf my mother passess first? He lives in taht house in thanjavur alone. What do I do about that? I live here and my life is here. I have to live with that. I think I will have to let him have whatever company he wants to have. Fine. \n\nIn that sense who do I owe for all of my success - is there credit to be offered for something that they did beyond a point - like supporting financially during divorce? Is there a line above a bare minimum for which I owe thanks? What about the time he got me a internet dongle in tCs trivandrum when he dropped me off. is it better seen as him trying to prevent me from getting carried away with tryingot access intenret. i think so.. \n"
