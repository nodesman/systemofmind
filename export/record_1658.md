Would HR have told me if there was actually a pip and in sure they won't lie to say they took action on two people in the context of this right? A part of me that combined this information the brain that's so full of canvas wonders if my having been on sick leave contributed to them going with my narrative and even lie to me? They gave to on record to my lawyer too so I doubt they would have lied. So we're sure there was no real pip. I even wondered if the HR person would have been checking in February if I pieced things together or not in February. Would they have actually have done a constructive dismissal or it's definitely got to do with these two individuals.sorry if it seems like I'm paranoid but was there a performance issue and they just ran with my story and got rid of me anyway? Like the performance issue would have ended?

They said they took action on two people to me orally not to my lawyer in writing. They mentioned that they gave the manager guy diversity training in writing. Which makes me ah why give him that (which must be true becaus they put it in writing) Why bother when they're making him sign an MTA?

In the investigation report they said the PIP was based on feedback from team mates. But after I meet her the HR and then asked what the feedback from team mates was. And at that point she sheepishly said that ic couldn't handle interacting with me (I saw it as then cleverly wording this to say there was a pip to? Make me feel bad? Insane that they worded the very blackmaily as the pip but then if you think about it the 1-1 notes was about the number of tickets. If the HR person was under the professional conduct of not lying then she must have told the truth? Then what does that say about the whole premise of the prompts search for alternative explanation? And for the wording of the investigation report sent to my lawyer)


This seems like a self defeating line of questioning but this image also is in the mind.
