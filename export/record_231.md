So, there was one time, some manager, she came from behind and hugged him, hugged her, and she was shocked by it, and, you won't believe it, he, I think she was genuinely shocked by it, but the manager, one of the managers asked her, why, what are you surprised by, as if to legitimize this guy's behavior, this was messed up, I think this kind of thing contributed to what is going on.. they're systemically gaslighting her?
