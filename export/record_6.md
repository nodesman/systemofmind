I am surprised that you, of your own brought up, what about my initial prompt made you think about how I came across my behavior or something. I am just surprised how did you infer that. You inferred that you seem to have a lot more context than some potentially politically incorrect assumptions, which I am totally okay with. But they seem that they may be relevant or you are just telling me what I want to hear. I hope you didn't manipulate it or you have some valid assumptions.
