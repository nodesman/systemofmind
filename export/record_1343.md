  "content": "I want you to think about the reality of potentially Netherlands becoming the new USA for highly talented people seeking a better living outside of a high pressure high friction life. Set aside concerns of if this is going to be a good thing for the Netherlands. The housing crisis and evrytihng. Is it not popularly known to Indians and is that why I do not see the esteem of it. I think so. Most Indians can't point Netherlands on a map. And what is even teh trajectory in terms of life steps to get here? I came by joining booking.com and I waded through opportunity to opportunity. So that trajectory that is well established to be taken like going to the usa and living in some dorm with students and doing ad egree and then getting a job and then getting a h1-b eventually buying a house and then getting a green card - game. \n"
