  "content": "Calude, I am strugglgin with this auestion - he lied to undermine my performance. i knew he was lying because the things he said i did did not match up with things i know i did and his accusation about me having gone on sicke lave and being at fault for that was also a bit weird and my defense for that was based on me knowing that i ti si my right. what i am looking for from you is if you see signs that the orchestrated lies about performance issues were aimed at telling lies to undermine my confidence on purpose and it took my own keeping of mental receipts and knwoing what is right and wrong to figure out what happened - imagine what would have otherwise have happened  iam shocked that this level of absue of trust was done.  i am torn between you always giving a theoretical answer because you are AI and having to ask you - of coures you will say no manager should lie but in practice - what do you think? lieing is 'just how things are done and HR will overlook it?'  or what exactly is the way to look at things? becuase there was so much dysfunction and indecent behavior that - i took issue wtih this IC's indecent behavior and this manager himself was beahving indecently like taunting and he non-chalantly lied so (this is what corrupt right? and it took my presence of mine passive kind of to detect it that too after going on sick leave and processing events after traumatically being gaslit) - almost like i was being treated like a stupid idealist for expecting people to be decent and keeping basic professional normms like not lying and cheating and behving respectfully and me being allowed to ask calrifying questions. i was also thinking that this therapist was saying that sometimes you are ebign abused in a job and it appears to be a case of constructive dismissal and therefore the wise thing to do is just avoid like he was saying this is how things happen? do things happen like that where they force someone to leave by being rude in the netherlands? are you supposed to take the sign and leave? i am not saying that is what happened to me but what he said seemed defeatist. that to solve the issue was to leave the company. i am all over the place in this issue. I guess it comes down to the question of who had good standards and who did not. How does one differentiate between naive idealist and someone who is expecting the bare minimum necessary? I mentioned that he mentioned those as well as did not mention the number of tickets in that litany meeting pointing to a lack of a cohesive story about what the PIP is about so imagine having to have had that level of mental model.
