In what ways was i set back? i went through spartan andhra pradesh junior colleges, okay chinmaya vidyalaya and then... university in vit.. but did these peple have nice. I did do drama once but didn't have drama school. or classes. i had some level of exposure to computer science classes enough to get hooked. but the classes were always poorly equipped. juior college no longer had compuer science classes it was spartand ahd execessive assignemtsn that wasted my time. \n\napparenlty they didnt have homework? does that mean i am better educated than them? apaprently they had classes i had earlier but they had it later? does that mean they had classes i couldnt and i learnt things that are never taught even until 12th grade in the dutch system? \n"
