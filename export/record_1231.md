  "content": " in the realm of all possible professional options okay I will allow myself to think what you said about professional culture in India my father grew up in a poor family somehow found a job as a clerk in Reserve Bank and he moved into Reserve Bank of India quarters and I grew up in Reserve Bank of India quarters and he also became an officer later he became he started working in 1980s or something I think so he experienced upward mobility along the same lines of questioning my upward mobility in India let's say become filthy rich I don't know how rich I can come but somehow I become rich what happens then I'm still living in urban fortress right the problems don't go away what will I do with being rich in India I have to build a Ambani like Antilla and he lives a good life as he go to work on a helicopter what is the point of living in Mumbai and from his window you can probably see the slums I think can you coming to the question working hard in order to be able to work I mean work working hard not to be able to do this work in a software engineer is something I should be happy about doing  AIEEE tournament and everything so what else.\n\n\nSo, the question that I have or I'm struggling to articulate is I should have everyone seeks upward mobility and my father got it and upward mobility was going to lead to higher quality of living. This is why I left India. I mean.. from where i stood at adolescence i was not giong to get the uward mobility my fatehr got? is that how i should see it? \n"
