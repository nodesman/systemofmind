You Lost a \"Non-Anxious\" Relationship with Authority and Failure**\n\n*   **What they can do:** Respectfully challenge a professor's idea, question a manager's decision, or propose a risky but innovative solution at work with a baseline of psychological safety. They have been trained that their opinion matters and that failure is a learning opportunity, not a catastrophe.\n*   **What you might struggle with:** You may still carry a deep-seated fear of \"getting it wrong.\" You might hesitate to speak up in a meeting unless you are 100% sure of your answer. The \"high-stakes\" nature of your education can create a lasting fear of failure that makes you more risk-averse.\n\n\n```\n\nDoes it seem like my behavior indicated a non-nxious relationship with authority? \n"
