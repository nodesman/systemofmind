He had sick leave on his calendar for 2 weeks overlapping with the day of that meeting. I can't tell who was fooling who - was the HR fooling me or was the manager hiding from HR? The sick leave on his calendar was noticed by me with my friend after I came back from that meeting. Not while being there with teh HR. I am not saying HR came to knwo abotu this but it is something that I and my friend noted. Keep in mind that the investigation started only after that meeting. There was no reason to think there would be an investigation that will be coming. The date of the meeting was also not something that was decided well in advance it was decided by me after falsly believing my friend was given information about my reintegration and that they were trying to get me back"
