Would they have told the manager the errors he committed and do you think knowing what we know about his personality and inclinations and worldview and approach (please list a point by point break down of it explicitly as is relevant and can be derived from all we've spoken till now and factually observed) do you think he knows or would have learnt of his error. I'm assuming a world view of seeking to improve but that may not be. I'm not asking if in the two scenarios what he should have done. I'm asking would he have learnt lessons. I'm asking given the cluster of behaviours we've seen does he seem like he would have learnt?
