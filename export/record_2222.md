And based on that, I inferred that the goal of that meeting was to intimidate me. Do you understand the analysis that was required? Because it did not add up in the larger scheme of things. So his goal was to do that so that he can make suggestions to me that would make sense. I don't have a biological clock or a sense of day and night. The concept of morning and the specific part of the 24-hour cycle isn't relevant in my view. So he left me thinking like that, fearing for something. So that he can make suggestions for things that would bother him by saying things like, become an architect, and then make me fear him or not do something that would allow me to bother him. And so, see, it took me to see, potentially, I had some sense of it, that this was being done, and in order to resolve so-called the situation, as well as retaliate for that meeting interaction. - still putting this together so that i can move forward. please wait.
