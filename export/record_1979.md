I am writing to share the summary of the impartial workplace investigation I conducted into the allegations raised by Mr. Rajeskharan Sundararaj. This matter was brought to my attention on 4 March 2024. I conducted an investigative interview with Mr. Sundararaj on 12 March 2024 wherein he shared the below allegations with me verbally. To reach these impartial findings, as set out below, I considered Mr. Sundararaj’s witness interview and associated documentary evidence provided by him thereafter, interview testimonies from other witnesses, and documentation and testimonies from the subjects of this investigation, Mr. Alexandre Dalzochio (manager of Mr. Sundararaj) and Mr. Daniel Lotz (peer of Mr. Sundararaj). Please find below summary of the findings of my investigation as they relate to Mr. Sundararaj’s allegations. Mr. Sundararaj alleged that his line manager, Mr. Dalzochio Dalzochio instructed him to take statutory annual leave (holiday) time off rather than sick days when he was ill, during a conversation in December 2022, and further, instructed him to work in the evenings when taking said vacation days. My investigation did not substantiate the allegation that Mr. Dalzochio instructed Mr. Sundararaj to take statutory holiday leave rather than sick leave days when he was ill, and to work in the evenings when taking statutory annual leave days. My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio conducted a duty of care conversation with Mr. Sundararaj, based on HR's inquiry into the amount of sick leave days Mr. Sundararaj was taking, particularly on Fridays, which was flagged in the HR system. HR reached out to Mr. Dalzochio to understand if there were any concerns with Mr. Sundararaj’s health and/or wellbeing, and query whether any assessment or supports were required, given the amount of sick leave days Mr. Sundararaj had logged in Workday (ServiceNow’s Time Off and Leave tracking system). My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio held a conversation with Mr. Sundararaj to understand how he was doing and inquire about his frequent sick days he had been taking on Fridays. As part of this conversation, my investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio encouraged Raj to take statutory holiday time off, as he noticed that Mr. had not been utilizing this. My investigation found that as part of this conversation, Mr. Dalzochio reminded Mr. Sundararaj that he should not \"abuse\" sick leave days, but never implied nor directly specified that Raj should not take sick days when he was ill or feeling unwell. He encouraged him to continue taking sick leave days as needed, but additionally advised him to take statutory annual leave days, as appropriate. Further, my investigation did not substantiate that Mr. Dalzochio advised Mr. Sundararaj to work in the evenings when he was taking vacation/statutory holiday time off. Mr Sundararaj alleged that following taking 1.5 further sick days in June 2023, Mr. Dalzochio held a further conversation with him querying these sick leave days. Further, Mr. Sundararaj alleged that during the same conversation, Mr. Dalzochio informed him that he was going to be placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP). Mr. Sundararaj alleged that he viewed the discussion of being placed on a performance improvement plan as threatening and retaliatory for taking 1.5 days of sick leave earlier in June. My investigation did not substantiate the allegation that Mr. Dalzochio threatened Mr. Sundararaj with a performance improvement plan (PIP) in retaliation for him taking sick leave in June 2023. My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio held had a conversation with Mr. Sundararaj on 21 June, 2023 to check in on his wellbeing, given he had taken 1.5 days of sick leave and during this conversation, Mr. Dalzochio again reminded Mr. Sundararaj that he should be taking his statutory annual leave, as he had only taken one day since January 2023 and reminded him that they had a similar conversation previously. My investigation found that on 21 June, 2023, there was a discussion between Mr. Dalzochio and Mr. Sundararaj regarding his performance, and specifically that Mr. Sundararaj was not meeting the expectations of his role as a Staff Software engineer, based on Mr. Dalzochio’s observations and poor feedback about Mr. Sundararaj’s engagement from stakeholders and peers. My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio had provided Mr. Sundararaj with constructive feedback on his performance since May 2023, and that the discussion on 21 June, 2023 was a continuation of that discussion, which continued and was again documented in an email from Mr. Dalzochio on 12 July, 2023, based on ongoing performance feedback Mr. Dalzochio had been receiving. My investigation found that the performance concerns Mr. Dalzochio highlighted were credible and that there was not any connection between the discussion of the implementation of a PIP and Mr. Sundararaj’s 1.5 days of sick leave in June 2023. My investigation did not find that the discussion of implementing a PIP was retaliatory on the basis of my findings. Mr. Sundararaj alleged that Mr. Dalzochio made a comment to him, about him being too \"macho\" in meetings, and implied that Brazilian men and Indian men can come across as \"macho\" sometimes. Mr. Sundararaj found this comment discriminatory, given the allegation that Mr. Dalzochio attributed his behaviour to his Indian nationality. a. My investigation substantiated that Mr. Dalzochio made a comment to Raj about him being too \"macho\" in meetings, and implied that Brazilian men and Indian men can come across as \"macho\" sometimes. My investigation found that this comment was indeed inappropriate. My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio was remorseful about making the comment and during investigative interview, he candidly reflected on the inappropriate nature of this comment, and that the feedback should have been addressed in a different way. Further, my investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio made this comment based on feedback from a female member of his team, and based on his own observations of how Mr. Dalzochio appeared to act dismissive towards this female. My investigation found that the intention of Mr. Dalzochio in delivering this feedback to Mr. Sunararaj was to coach him on being mindful of his engagements with all members of the team, and express that it is important that Mr. Sundararaj not come across as dismissive towards female colleagues. My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio did not have this discussion with Mr. Sundararaj due to his national origin, and that he would have had a similar coaching conversation with any other member of his team under the same circumstances. As remediation following this investigation, I have recommended that HR engage with Mr. Dalzochio on how to appropriately deliver sensitive feedback and have recommended that Mr. Dalzochio complete a series of Diversity and Inclusion trainings as a result of this finding. Mr. Sundararaj alleged that Mr. Dalzochio tried to \"cover his tracks\" by cancelling the meetings on the Outlook calendar where he delivered constructive performance feedback to Mr. Sundararaj. Mr Sundararaj alleged that he viewed this as Mr. Dalzochio attempting to deny that these meetings occurred. My investigation did not substantiate the allegation that Mr. Dalzochio tried to \"cover his tracks\" by cancelling the meetings on the Outlook calendar where he gave Mr. Sundararaj performance feedback after they occurred. My investigation found that Mr. Dalzochio confirmed that these meetings took place and advised that these meetings appeared as “cancelled”, as he cancelled the entire series of meetings with Mr. Sundararaj (which resulted in historic meetings appearing as “cancelled”). Mr. Dalzochio explained that he cancelled the meeting series after he was notified that Mr. Sundararaj was going to be out on sick leave for an extended period of time. Mr. Dalzochio did not dispute that these meetings occurred, and had no intention of \"covering his tracks\" as he stood by what was said in those meetings. Mr. Sundararaj alleged that his peer, Mr. Daniel Lotz made a number of discriminatory comments towards Indian nationals during a team lunch in the summer of 2020. My investigation substantiated that Mr. Lotz made two insensitive comments regarding India and Indian developers during a team lunch in the summer of 2020. My investigation substantiated that Mr. Lotz made a comment to the effect of “I heard Indian tea is good, isn’t that why the British colonized you?” and “I heard Indian [software] developers are shit. Is that true?”. My investigation found that neither of these comments were made directly to Mr. Sundararaj, but to other members of the team of Indian nationality. My investigation found that these comments were inappropriate and potentially offensive, but that they were addressed promptly and appropriately at the time by Mr. Dalzochio and appropriate action was taken. Further, my investigation found that, at investigative interview, Mr. Lotz was apologetic regarding these comments and explained that he made these comments as he comes from a country that is often considered \"unsafe\", is also a former British colony, and he was trying to make parallels between his native country and the country that some of his team members were from. He reflected on his behaviour and the remediation that took place at the time and advised that these are not comments he would ever make now. Mr. Sundararaj alleged that Mr. Lotz made two comments on “pull requests” that Mr. Sundararaj understood to be bullying. Further, Mr. Sundararaj alleged that within these comments, Mr. Lotz was attempting to assert authority which he did not have, as he was not in a leadership or technical lead position. My investigation substantiated that the comments alleged by Mr. Sundararaj were made on 30 June 2023, stating “did you just merge this in the middle of a conversation?” and 12 July 2023, stating “The API filters were all added for good reason we sure as hell did not all go write them in after the fact because it was fun. This is not something up for debate”. My investigation did not find that these comments were inappropriate or that they rose to the level of bullying. The pull requests in question STRY54994228 and STRY54994219 were part of a project that Mr. Lotz and another peer, Mr.Koukoutsis were selected to lead and manage from the Dev-par-appollo team side. My investigation found that Mr. Lotz had been working on this project for 6 months prior to it being introduced to Mr. Sundararaj and Mr. Lotz and another employee, Mr.Koukoutsis were tasked with and pulling in other team members such as Mr. Sundararaj to support with various aspects of the project. Given Mr. Lotz was formally assigned to lead this project, he had adequate authority and subject matter expertise on this project. Therefore, I found the comment and question he posed to Mr. Sundararaj were acceptable within this context. The comment made on 12 July, is a comment that may have been worded more appropriately for the professional workplace, however, fundamentally, taking into account the context of the project, my investigation did not find this comment to be problematic. Further, it is of note that my investigation found that Mr. Sundararaj may have found it difficult to accept direction and feedback from Mr. Lotz, as was hired at a lower IC level (more junior position) than Mr. Sundararaj and promoted to the same IC level as Mr. Sundararaj prior to these comments being made. Mr. Sundararaj also expressed dissatisfaction with taking direction from Mr. Lotz during our interview and expressed a lack of collegial respect for Mr. Lotz. Conclusion: Based on my investigation findings, I conclude that the majority of Mr. Sundararaj’s allegations were not substantiated, except for the allegation that Mr. Dalzochio made an inappropriate comment to Mr. Sundararaj about him coming across as \"macho\" in meetings, and the allegation that Mr. Lotz made an insensitive comment about India and Indian software developers during a team lunch in the summer of 2020. As noted above the allegations with respect to Mr. Lotz’s comments in 2020 were addressed appropriately at the time, from my perspective. I recommend that HR explore the possibility of reintegration for Mr. Sundararaj, given that he expressed his desire to return to \"normalcy\". However, I note that Mr. Sundararaj stated firmly that he is unwilling to work with Mr. Dalzochio and/or Mr. Lotz moving forward. I appreciate Mr. Sundararaj’s patience and cooperation during the investigation. Should you have any further questions, please direct them to Ms. Kris Friechmann. Sr People Partner. Thank you and best regards, Claudia -- dont take it at face value"
