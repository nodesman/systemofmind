  "content": "\nYou said your duty is to forge a better future because you have a \"vague sense that a future in which Indians have firmly a powerful feature in the human future is important.\" You also stated that this is to be done by \"building a better India to live in.\"\n\n**Why?**\n\n**Why is it *personally* so important *to you* that the \"Indian civilization\" as a specific, geopolitical entity has a powerful future on the world stage? What deep, personal need is fulfilled by this vision? What is the feared alternative if this does not happen?**\n\nA future with a better India is a good India. India has a strange idealism about the world. Every other nation chooses self interest and extractive behaviour. But Indian civilisation and the way the Indian nation behaves on the world stage is surprisingly idealistic and sometimes frustratingly self-sacrificial. Is it altruistic? Actually yes. It is. Many times. Like what it did during covid. It tried to support Turkey after the earth quake a country that is hostile. A country that acts very very restrained and by the rules frustratingly so. It holds itself to a very high bar for conduct. Sure there were instances of funding secessionism in Sri Lanka through LTTE though I do not konw if that was damaging or if there was justified backing. Was India bringing African Union into G20 not idealism? Not altruism? India could behave like a hegemon to Maldives but it is surprisingly restrained. It could invade and topple Bangladesh why not? It could sanction entities from operating in Pakistan (which I think it should). India has many many many times time and time again tried to say a stable pakistan is in India’s interest but to no avail before the recent changes. Only of late has India started to pull out of one sided and generous deals like the trade deals with south east asia, the IWT, etc - magnanimity has been abused and nt appreciated. If the strategy of magnanimity is not successful the world will descend into bickering Gand more conflict and the human condition will not reach the next stage whatever that is. This is all sounding weird. I know. But are my premises wrong? If so please feel free to say so. Americans think their country is great but we know from outside that they have toppled democracies and backed dictatorships and protected genocides all the time. May be I have a blindspot in that sense? \n\nIndians wherever we go are a positive force - we have always made the place better. No crime, been positive contributors in all societies. A way of thinking and living that is emulated by SEA even if they dont credit us for it. Or am I taking too much credit be blunt please. I am not happy about the lack of cleanliness or the caste system or the shitty karma system that is used to justify oppression. Don’t get me wrong. There are many things I do not like about India and Indian society. But overall people of this generation seem mostly good. If my answer could go into more facets please feel free to ask and I will. I am almost meandering. \n"
