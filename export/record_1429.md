Living in India, it feels like living among people who are selfish and irritating stupid uncles, irritating people, jerks then what on the world stage am I proud of? I mean all fairness, that entire thought is true because I deserve better and I'm here now Does that seem like racism towards my own kind? It's just that some people's behavior was not good Most people's behavior was not good Definitely not in my household People who are not my family, not my brother Very few people outside, not in my relative circle Maybe someone who I met\n"
