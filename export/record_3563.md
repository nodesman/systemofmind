You are correctâ€”they fit perfectly, and analyzing them reveals why they behave the way they do.\n\nLet's place Capitalism, Communism, and Socialism on the gradient.\n\n---\n\n### **Capitalism: A Derived-Dynamic System (at its core)**\n\nAt its purest, theoretical core, capitalism is a **Derived-Dynamic** system.\n\n*   **It is Derived:** Its foundational principles were not inherited from ancient scripture or tradition. They were *derived* by thinkers like Adam Smith from first-principles observations of human nature and economic exchange. The core idea is that a system built on individual self-interest, private property, and free markets will, through an \"invisible hand,\" create the most efficient allocation of resources and the greatest overall prosperity.\n*   **It is Dynamic:** The system is in a state of constant, chaotic evolution. It is driven by what economist Joseph Schumpeter called **\"creative destruction.\"** Old industries are destroyed by new technologies. New markets are constantly being created. The system is never static; it is a perpetual, unpredictable process of adaptation and change.\n\n**However, in practice, most modern \"capitalist\" societies are not pure Derived-Dynamic systems.** They are a hybrid:\n\n*   The *economic engine* is **Derived-Dynamic** (the free market).\n*   The *social and political container* for that engine is often **Inherited-Dynamic** (a nation-state with a constitution, a set of cultural traditions, and a legal framework that it seeks to preserve while adapting).\n\nThis creates the central tension of modern capitalism: how to manage the explosive, destabilizing force of the dynamic market within the stable container of a society.\n\n### **Communism (Marxism-Leninism): A Derived-Static Model (The Ideology)**\n\nPure, state-based Communism, as practiced in the 20th century (e.g., the Soviet Union, Mao's China), is a perfect example of a **Derived-Static** model.\n\n*   **It is Derived:** Like capitalism, its principles were not inherited from ancient tradition. They were *derived* by Karl Marx from his analysis of history and economics. He created a new, comprehensive theory of the world based on class struggle.\n*   **It is Static:** This is the crucial part. Once Marx's theory was codified and implemented by states (Leninism, Maoism), it hardened into a **rigid, inerrant, and quasi-religious dogma.**\n    *   The \"sacred texts\" became the writings of Marx and Lenin.\n    *   The \"priesthood\" became the Communist Party.\n    *   Any deviation from the official party line was not just a disagreement; it was a heresy to be brutally punished.\n*   **The Inevitable Collision with Reality:** The model was static, but the world was dynamic. The system was completely incapable of adapting to new information (like the fact that its agricultural policies were causing mass starvation). Because the model was considered perfect, any failure was blamed not on the model, but on \"class enemies,\" \"saboteurs,\" and \"counter-revolutionaries.\" This is the classic failure mode of a Derived-Static ideology: when reality conflicts with the map, you punish reality.\n\n### **Socialism: The Dynamic Element That Can Exist in Both**\n\nYou are exactly right. Socialism is not a complete system in the same way as the other two. It is better understood as a set of **dynamic principles** that can be integrated into different types of systems.\n\nSocialism is the principle that the **collective (society) has a right and a duty to moderate the excesses of the dominant system for the well-being of all its members.**\n\n*   **Socialism within a Capitalist Framework (Inherited-Dynamic Social Democracy):**\n    *   This is the model of most modern European countries, including the Netherlands.\n    *   The **inherited foundation** is the capitalist market economy.\n    *   The **dynamic principle** of socialism is applied to it in the form of:\n        *   Progressive taxation to fund a robust social safety net (healthcare, unemployment benefits).\n        *   Strong labor laws and unions to protect workers.\n        *   Public investment in education and infrastructure.\n    *   This is an **Inherited-Dynamic** system. It accepts the capitalist foundation but dynamically \"reforms\" it with socialist principles to create a more equitable and stable society.\n\n*   **Socialism within a Communist Framework (The Failed Ideal):**\n    *   In theory, Communism was supposed to be the ultimate expression of socialism.\n    *   In practice, the **Derived-Static** nature of the authoritarian state crushed any dynamic, bottom-up socialist ideals. The \"collective\" was not the people; it was the Party. The system became a form of state capitalism, where the Party elite acted as the new exploiting class.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Capitalism** is, at its core, a **Derived-Dynamic** economic engine.\n*   **Communism** is a **Derived-Static** political ideology that is profoundly brittle and anti-adaptive.\n*   **Socialism** is a set of **dynamic principles** that can be applied to different systems. When applied to capitalism, it creates the **Inherited-Dynamic** model of social democracy that is the dominant system in the Western world outside of the more purely capitalist United States."
