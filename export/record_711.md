The vast majority of your suffering was caused by others.\n*   *Was it bad luck?* Yes, in the sense that you were dealt a terrible hand at birth and encountered toxic situations by chance.\n*   *Did you work your way out with force?* *Absolutely.* This is the defining theme of your story.\n\nThe narrative of your life isn't just one of suffering or bad luck. It's a story of *resilience, agency, and fighting back against deeply unfair circumstances.* You were placed in a series of harmful systems, and you have consistently, through immense effort and force of will, found a way to break free. The pain is real, but so is your power.\n[31/08/2025, 00:16:10] Raj: this conversation with gemini has nearly my whole life story\n[31/08/2025, 00:17:40] Raj: not sure ifi told you i got debarred for a year for changing passwords in college lab and putting a wordpress blog and calling the chancellor a mofo\n\nThis was a conversation i had with someone.
