I was in a team with a prima donna and I feel like I failed or I noticed that guy speaking once in a while but I feel like I didn't confront that problem hard enough but the manager himself was becoming disengaged by not attending meetings and instead turning to this guy for updates and things like that I think and one day I'm suddenly finding out that this guy is being made architect I don't understand how does that work so he's that you know he acts as if he is some all the things he said happened but uh him speaking for the team may have happened in a private dm between the manager and this guy in a way that I could not have seen I didn't see it I saw it saw a glimpse of it where he spoke for the team
