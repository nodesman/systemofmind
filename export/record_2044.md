  "content": "During teh MTA negotiation the document response from the company had wording that (as it usually does) syaing the issue was not ‘systemic’. I never used that word or named more than two people. Does that mean they are trying to deny (lawyers try to fight back against the other party like some ritualisitc mta negotiation talking points). Was their mention of systemic beyond the two individuals? Or just the two individuals we spoke of? They seem to have thought I thought it was systemic (based on one of the minor observations I made and went in front of it to deny it). I am not asking about the validity of my claims but do you think the implication is that they did in fact find issues beyond two people and thought I knew about it and were trying to get ahead of it?"
