There is one thing that I am not able to reconcile - this manager was aggressively selling the fiction hat he is retiring. He was even lined up his fellow brazilian manager to sell it to his reports. He would constantly post about the retirement in every post. “Did I make a mistake by retiring?” in jest to thank someone for their help that (implying that he will stop benefiting from his relationship with them) someone who closed an issue that made his job easier. This instance is after the news of his retirement came out. My indian friend noted that he wasn’t particularly sad very mildly didn’t even acknowledge him when he encountered him in the elevator but seemed adept at hiding the fact that he was forced out by HR. Was he sufficiently incentivised to not show it or does he seem like a incredibly good charade player in every day interactions in the face of such bad outcomes for him? Did they pay him so much that he didn’t feel sad? He came to the office to have one final meal with his fellow Brazilians. Which was also odd. 

We know that 4 years prior in 2021 he struggled to find a job. Which he admitted to someone in some team lunch. With what else we know about his circumstances we know he didn't exactly retire. 

But the HR person (K) who I met with (who seems to have had knowledge of the full scale of the problem including the fact that in the months leading up to event in June 2023 I had asked him for help to deal with the toxicity and he asked me to attend the meeting because ia m being paid for it - she mentioned that abstractly in the meeting in July 2024 when she gave me the MTA document that “If your manager didn’t help you you should have gotten in touch with HR, that’s what we are here for”). This fact seems relevant for two reasons - she recognises that this was a moment that could have prevented something (although she is saying it like its my fault), this seems to have come up out of the investigation and it came out only AFTER the investigation. They discovered this as having occurred after I gave them my 1-1 notes. To this HR person let’s call her K. I only told her that I was being blackmailed with PIP (basically when events precipitated in june 2023 and not the events leading up to that in the preceding months)



My worry in all this is was i the one lonely person whose perception was being managed while they were all in on it from day one and they were carefully corralling their exposure? Did the manager get the book thrown at him and got sent out (the 1-1 note evidence indicates they did find failure on his part)

I am entertaining this line of reasoning because I am wondering if they paid him so much to leave or was he forced to ‘retire’ but did a show of it in line with the charade they were all playing. 

If we know that some level of systemic issue was present in regards to what we discussed about the director - my manager’s manager. There was HR handover between August 2023 and Feb 2024. This person K mentioned in feb 2024 that she is sorry that they could not help sooner because of unavailability of HR support. 

Meaning - was i being a lonely gullible unpragmatic idealist whose perception was the only thing being managed? Did the lawyer’s request for the investigation report make the commit to a story that they can defend forcing them to serve the MTA? Were they going to, had I not contacted HR, paint a story in the narrative and manage me into some suitable outcome?

What does it look like happened?
