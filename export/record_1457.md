You did say some things about the alternatives like suburban hell and indian fortress life. \n\nThe other confusion is I live in Amsterdam oost. In this neighborhood. One part of me says I am lucky to be here. Another part ofme says this is not the best place to live and there are even more upscale places. But where? I had been working through some pain in the form of trauma in the past years so I feel both alone and trauma associated with this neighborhood. But this is the life I fought so hard and we have been discussing so far to determine is the one that is best for us in this life time forever?\n\nThis is goign to sound odd.. but thinking that i am going to live in this neighborhood forever for the nearly next 50 years is new and daunting. Even my parents move daround enough. But my cousins did not move around that much. They pretty much stayed in Thanjavur. Makes me question what is the world I am traversing. \n\nOff topic but I caught yself thinking about the American life sliglty and identifying with American problems and distancing myself from it. Whichi s great. I will do more of it. I was reading some social media post and for a moment I was able to see it as a distant problem and not something that was relevant to me because it was written in wording that did not specify that so and so happened in America or something.. it was easy to fall into the pattern of identifying with the problem in that place. But I feel that I have a ways to go. This is necessary for my healing. \n\nWe do remember the idnetification we had to do - the placing oneself in teh anglophone totem pole. The kind that koreans seem to do. Even chinese seem to want to create a mirror image of anglophone world and have a copium like tendency where they both seem to get off on putting down indians which is pathetic. I am starting to realize how flawed both of their societies are. I am however struggling to reconcile the idea of me being \n\nAnother truth I recently came across that slightly gives me panic is that I am one of the few indians in this neighborhood. that I am a pioneer. In Netherlands. I kind of am and I should be proud of it. One of the first few in this neighborhood. Early stage of late stage gentrification where the occupation of a neighborhood shifts from white people to brown people being indians. \n"
