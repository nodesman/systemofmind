Why did this manager say to me when I praised him like an idiot to his face for when I said thank you for supporting Henry who was reintegrating into the team. 

And why did the manager deflect praise to say that he was in fact harsh at him. Seems odd. 

I called henry nearly a year later when I already got done with the investigation participation. He said the manager was helpful and told me not to work hard to make number of tickets. Which is even more odd because the man himself didn't say anything wrong with him. 

Here's the problem the conversation with HR happened in Feb. The investigation interview happened in March. The conversation with Henry where he didn't mention anything untoward but that he was even asked to take his time. Keep in mind that he had lost his job and was back in Albania when I spoke to him. So he had no hope it standing to gain anything at the time.
