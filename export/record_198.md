I don’t have a concept of indecent people. Or harmful people. What do I even do with that concept - like I should be judgemental of people right? What about empathy? I was giving people the benefit of doubt but I was not perceptive and conclusive and based on that treat people?

What do you think?

response:
It sounds like you’re grappling with the balance between empathy and discernment—how much benefit of the doubt to give people while still protecting yourself from those who act harmfully. Let’s break this down clearly:

1. Empathy vs. Judgment
	•	Empathy is understanding why someone acts a certain way, seeing their struggles, and not immediately assuming the worst.
	•	Judgment (or discernment) is assessing how their behavior impacts you and deciding how to respond.
	•	Being nonjudgmental does not mean being naive—it means you recognize reality while maintaining self-respect.

2. You Were Not Perceptive Enough—Why?
	•	You assumed good faith even when people repeatedly gave you signals that they were not acting in good faith.
	•	You looked for ways to understand them rather than set a boundary when you needed to.
	•	You thought being fair meant giving them more chances instead of acknowledging patterns of behavior.

3. What to Do with the Concept of “Indecent” or Harmful People?
	•	Recognize that not everyone operates with good intentions.
	•	Some people have self-serving agendas and use others to achieve them.
	•	People’s incompetence, biases, or emotional needs can drive them to act harmfully, even if they don’t intend to.
	•	It’s not your job to fix or understand them—your job is to recognize when someone’s behavior is harmful and protect yourself.

4. How to Avoid This in the Future
	•	Be quicker to assess repeated behavior. A one-time mistake is one thing, but patterns matter.
	•	Notice discomfort early—when someone repeatedly makes you feel bad or confused, don’t dismiss it.
	•	Trust yourself. If you feel manipulated or devalued, don’t wait for more proof. That feeling is proof enough.
	•	Hold people accountable sooner. Instead of just trying to understand, ask yourself, “What happens if this continues?”

5. Empathy is Not an Excuse
	•	You can understand why someone behaves a certain way without tolerating it.
	•	You can recognize that someone may be acting from stress, insecurity, or incompetence, but that does not excuse harming others.
	•	Empathy does not mean excusing harmful actions, just as judgment does not mean cruelty.

6. Your Takeaway
	•	You need to develop a faster internal process for identifying harmful people.
	•	Instead of only analyzing people, act sooner to protect yourself.
	•	Boundaries > Endless Benefit of Doubt. Set consequences for repeated bad behavior instead of just watching it unfold.
	•	You don’t have to categorize everyone you meet, but you do have to recognize who deserves your trust.

So yes, be judgmental in the sense of assessing patterns of behavior. Not everyone deserves endless chances.
