Always.. any reason for that to change? Any reason for people ot not need good food? Faster food. \n\nWe will have roads forever. We will drive on them. May be they will be electric but we will continue to drive on rthem. Ultimately for millenea life on earth will involve some tings that we have figured out now? Why would we not have automobiles? Wha can possibly improve on automobiles other than portals? Which changes where we can even be on the earth.. and universe. Is the problem that we cannot go faster? No. We have teh fastest possible cars. May be drones can deliver. But why would a drone improve over a truck. Until the dron highways get full. What then? Trains will exist. We will hve to wear clothes. Still sleep on beds. Phones are great but may be we ahv ereached a living substrate end? We will have robots at home doing work that is painful which is great like keeping places clean. What then.. MAY BE THE way forward is a simple life with the people around us and happiness.
