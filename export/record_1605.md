I wanted to ask this again, but why did I, because I cannot have foreseen him do something this unethical. But I thought he would have some level of professionalism, this manager himself, but turns out he did not. HR even upon recognising that I tried to solve the issue with him and he refused to do it, told me that I should have contacted HR. To me it looks like  I've done everything I could but was victimized anyway. Severely. I could be wrong about my assessment. This manager explicitly asked me give this individual eye benefit of the doubt. In the face of such things how can I have had the insight to contact HR. It look the level of conviction that I had to even report the eventual actions but to ask to have had even more seem unfair. I'm just struggling to move forward because of the unfairness of this happening a second time
