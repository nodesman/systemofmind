  "content": "When I was working in this company in Amsterdam, I felt that the level of the work here was inferior, and that I would be outgrowing it very quickly, and that I needed to... overcome it as soon as possible, meaning I felt like I had to leave that place for somewhere better. I knew there are two other places, which are Uber and Databricks, which were better. But... I'm talking about Amsterdam, by the way. What I'm also saying is, it was also... in the sense of what is possible. See, I felt that maybe the grade of work can be even higher somewhere else. I don't know. But I think I'm trying to unravel some understanding or some idea of progression. Can you help me unravel that? Because... this is also part of a pain that I'm experiencing. If I felt that I had to go further, I felt that the further up my career ladder, subconsciously felt like some version of me living, or rather working in the US, in some tech company, and somehow that is going to be better than what I'm doing now. How is that possible? You know? That also was... I'm not sure if I'm communicating this properly. I had this impression that I could do better, I could have a better work experience, but I imagined it as something in the USA. There are a couple of other places in the Netherlands, but it was largely something... it was an ideal that I believed to be something that's present in the USA, in most places, perhaps in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn the early to mid 2010s I was let to think wow facebook, menlo park, some of my friends even work tehre. microsoft, they have the reversed sun microsystems sign as a message to employees. that vagary is in my mind about what i am missing out on - where all the action is - in silicon valley (but the truth is facebook is hiring in london which is not veyr far and google is hiring in zurich which is also not very far and ther must be some development office for microsoft as well. \n\nbut somehow this association and equating of a advancement upwards to the usa to my a) continued survival in this profession this is why another reason why i am not able to easily let go of the usa for some reason - my advancement as a software engiener seems tied to some belief of destiny in the usa b) the path for me to level up in my profession too tied to being in the usa. \n\nwhat I am trying to ask you is \n\n1. Tell me what you understand about the situation.  \n2. can you help me uncover the assumptions and beliefs thare are here - there was something about progression, i imagine higher progression from what i saw in the servicenow in amsterdam - i had a picture of something like i used to be able to do in thoughtworks. it was not clear what exactly it is that i thought was better than Servicenow that i would have experienced in usa in what ways. but i expected more discipline. \n\nWhile it informed my decision to leave servicenow it was a vauge and unclear idea that i did not clearly think through. may be my options in Netherlands are modest. Regardless I would like us to do a round of piercing questions to determine the career angle of the anglophone \n\ni realize ive written a lot i do not want to lose any observations, feedback so we can create headings that i can request in subsequent turns that will expand to give a more erudite version if necessary for you a) undersatnding of the situation b) observations not stated and not obvious infered and heuristic  c) questionaire to discover the lay of my belief system \n"
