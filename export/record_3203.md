  "content": "I had drafed this email on August 12, 2023 and put it away in workflowy:\n\n\nSubject : Resignation: Regarding,\nI do not see continued employment with ServiceNow in the DA department as it stands now to be a gainful employment and I wish to start the process towards my exit from my function as Staff Software Engineer at ServiceNow. I can see that continued functioning in this role in this BU is going to cause atrophy to my hard won skills and abilities and damage my mental health.\nThe reasons for this are as follows:\nBullying and Unethical Conduct: \nAlex seems to think threatening (or even actually placing) me in a PIP for the supposed incidents that happened was a good way to handle team conflicts. \nSome how I had good performance right up until June and then suddenly I became PIP worthy in June.\nI believe the incident that inspired this conduct is I gave critical feedback of Daniel in writing. And what happened was in retaliation of that. He wanted to discredit me by marking me as a poor performer so he can achieve the outcome of promoting Daniel and giving him free reign. \nI do not trust Alex - he has shown himself capable of doing incredibly unethical things, did something that severely affected my well being to achieve his personal goals with little regard. \nHe has lied about multiple things, withholds information - including feedback that others supposedly offered on me.\nHe openly said he bludgeoned Henri into burning out a second time. \nAlex told me in a 1-1 that I am to concede to all points and become subservient to any and all things that Daniel does because he is going to become the architect in the department. \nThis is not how a software engineering team functions. Software engineering is a team sport and me having to meet the whims and fancies of a single individual is not the way to go. \nEven if I were to concede - there seems to be no way to keep incidents from occurring - there was a situation where I asked a innocent question in a team grooming meeting and thought not much about it. In the following one on one I was told I \"argued\" and created more conflict. This leads me to a position where there is no winning strategy for me to function in my role. Any and all utterances from me are unwelcome. \nThe way things stand right now it is Alex's fiefdom and his favorites have free reign in behaving any way they wish. I am not interested in function as anyone's personal vassal. I only work for professional organizations. \nPromotion of Incompetence, Mediocrity: \nIt is unacceptable to me that this individual who doesn't have professional and personal maturity or even basic decency, have a say in my performance, and therefore be able to affect my well being here. \nThere is no scope for a change in outcome given the severity of the issues, the brazen unprofessionalism and unethical conduct I've witnessed (and was at the receiving end of) on the part of Alex. His excusing and even enabling of indecent conduct has had a severely negative impact on my health. I would literally take a pay cut work for nearly half the salary or just drive a cab or clean the tables in a restaurant if I must than have to work here. You deserve Daniel and all of his antics. \nYou might wonder why I am even writing all this if I could not come to you to solve this problem, Marko. I think there is a very small chance that you are unaware of the fact that Alex is actively working against your goals. I couldn't afford to be wrong about that and face severe consequences if I address them with you. In case you are that person - please do what you can to secure my other colleagues' well being. \nPlease consider this my formal notice and help me complete my exit formalities. \n\n\nfor when i land a job\n"
