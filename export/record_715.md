  "content": "We have established my father as a parasitic person. \n\nthere were people who experienced greater physical violence. things like being forced out of teh house, one friend said he was locked in a cupboard. another said he was made naked and something like that. \n\ni am not bargaining but how does one approach seeing my experience with that. how do we see it? I am asking for a realistic way to place my experience around all that. Again.. you already told me that it is not competitive suffering. But I am struggling to place my father as a monster.. is this what monsters look like? i think i've heard of arguents from my brother like \"did you know there are sexual abuses that are done in some families\" as if that is the only frame of reference for abuse. everything above that is fair game. I don't just want to hear \"yes you are right!\" i have been made to feel that this is idealism.. and the experience i had recently in the workplace makes me worry if i do have high idealism and i am expecting high behavioral standards. But that would be like asking people to come dressed to work in suits and askign people to speak grammtically correctly. etc.? respectful beahavior is not a excessive norm? \n\ncoming back to the qeustion of my father.. monsters are in jail for doign criminal things but monsters also roam everyday life? cause immense suffering in society? \n"
