Some people were asking how to leave India, how to get a job. I tried to give them a referral. This guy in Reddit, I met him, I gave him a referral to ThoughtWorks, he got rejected. Fine. And then he eventually found a job. And then what else? And then what else? Later, someone else. See, I have done deeds of turnice on a day to day basis. I even tried to fight the good fight of having someone bad removed. But I couldn't do it.\n\nme that I'm meandering, but I'm trying to say that in this situation, my pride based on this, based on this trajectory that I've taken, I want to ask you, my asking you if I should be proud is proud and do two different ways that I've done something that others cannot do. And there's also this otherwise that, oh, you will not become a IIT graduate. You have not become a San Francisco Google engineer. You will not become a chess grandmaster. Why are you proud? That's the other proud also I have. Even doing things for myself also I'm not able to do.\n\nSo how to be proud?\n"
