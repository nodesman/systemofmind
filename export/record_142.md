A.1 There are other questions about general tendences that i asked about can you identify which ones you did not answer that i asked and answer them. 

- Also a small correction - the taking to park was done upon the goading of the teacher who noticed the distance between me and father and recommended to him to take me to a park (to bridge the gap or whatever i dont remember their wordingbut they were trying to break ice or suggest things that would stop the thing) i dont know how someone with the mentality that my father had. I thought I'd correct this. Do not make the whole response about this one instance. Just wanted to add this correction. Please focus on A.1. However use factual statements here to contribute to any picture youa re building.
