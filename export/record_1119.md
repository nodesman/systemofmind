I took a higher paying job, AIEEE, then I did a TCS, then I went to ThoughtWorks, then I went to Chitika, then I went to Vestas, then I decided getting a higher paying job is not really important. And along the way I faced my parents tried to do forced financial marriage, which I forced, which I removed and got married to someone who I kind of liked at the time, but turned out she is not good. I got divorced, but the divorce happened in the Netherlands after I left India. But when I came to Netherlands, I faced harassment at booking.com and it was a bad place to work. If I went from one bad manager to the next, eventually burning out and then while also experiencing another divorce as well as, and then COVID happened and then I went to ServiceNow where I worked, where I initially had a good manager, then I was given a shit manager and then that guy ended up harassing me badly along with a peer, which ended in me burning out and then although I managed to get him fired, the incident was very, very severe and it hurt me. This individual in my team was behaving badly, was obstructing my work like asking for unrelated changes and pull requests and his manager was blaming me for not giving him the benefit of doubt, like not mollycoddling him the way he was doing. And his choice of action was to retaliate and to intimidate by undermining my confidence and hurting me. Again, I repeatedly escalated this individual. I've been escalating this individual from three years ago, from the three years prior to the harassment campaign. So, although in the investigation I managed to have him fired, by shit manager I mean, in both booking and ServiceNow, I was put in the path of someone who ended up harassing me. So, that's the problem that I am dealing with. Rather, see, I moved to the Netherlands and I somehow survived these five years and made my way towards naturalization, even bought a house in between. My question to you is, given the trajectory that you know I took, along the way I experienced, I had to die, you know the reason for why I left India, why staying would have been a, it's like a closing in of a set of walls that are closing in each other. Meaning like opportunities are closing, cities are getting more and more crowded and more busy, more chaotic, more dusty, more expensive, more difficult to live in. So, I'm just wondering how you see, knowing my entire history, what are you able to say why, what happened to me? Why today in August 10th, 2025, am I traumatized? AIEEE, all of this is journey. is it battlescars from the path and risks i took? \n\nbattle scars from bad luck of incidents that I endured meaning to other people see I moved to a Western European country to work in a company big company no one expects all of this to happen in fact some other people are still working there after joining there in 2017 I'm just wondering how were they able to advance well there when I face problems two different workplaces was it bad luck why did I why was I in a position of having to leave the country was it me seeking me seeking higher and higher things that put me in the path of this these people see you can go to a Western European country was it appropriate to expect the work environment to be better that booking.com and ServiceNow will be more civilized more disciplined that was that expectation was somewhat let down I'm just wondering what led me to the path of immigration was it greed or is am I like a refugee is that what we discussed I was acting for my own benefit in the future to build a family should I have a family again if we think of my life as an effort to build a family yes I mean sure the first marriage fell apart but if the goal was to have a good life for including a consideration for my future family my children then moving here made all the sense in the world because for example GE had 1.9 million people write exams up from I think 800,000 last year or something so the walls indeed are closing in India so I may have set my children up for success by moving here and in my lifetime things are not going to get better they're gonna get worse before they get better in India\n\nIf we think back to why what happened in booking.com happened, they were actually growing very fast and they hired a lot of people and they just made whoever agreed to be a manager just became manager. That resulted in some people who are unfit to be managers being made managers and resulting in the kind of impact that I endured. People who had no idea how to behave at the workplace were made managers. And then, that led to me being enduring some really horrible people at the workplace. And then I, what else? Similar thing happened in ServiceNow. I joined the company. It was very good on paper, but then some idiot was hired and who hired another idiot who ended up harassing me and promoting a toxic individual. I am as of today in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, Oost, and you know where I am. I'm just wondering why, is there one cause to the pain or is it battle scars from taking an otherwise legitimate path in life? What is the right answer? Is it who is to blame? Is it to blame myself? Why am I asking this question? Am I asking this question to blame myself or blame someone else? Because my parents changed after doing the, they agreed, they made a mistake and they changed how they behaved with me. After doing it, forced arranged marriage, they said they agreed, but my brother did not change. He's the same person. So I decided to cut my ties with him. He contributed to the great harm that happened during the forced arranged marriage issue. It looks like in some ways, I was harmed by people along the way who are reasons outside my control. And I fought back or at least tried to regain my agency in those things.\n\nyou think about the mother of three children who was a single mother who had a toe slug in the Netherlands for child care and she lost the house because of the toe slug affair for being flagged for fraud and then losing everything for no fault of her own and her children moving to some other house and then them growing up going apart from her and she losing her home and then she losing and going to living somewhere else and then and then only later giving restitution horrific. I am saying is it the right thing to do to see my struggles and pain thrugh the prism of external events and unfariness and me having survived it or am i coping.. i need a realsitic way to see why i am in pain today -\n\nsee it yesterday in 2025. I'm in sabbatical. I was born and I had an enormous trip and this is the first time I'm having a chance to take stock of life and review the whole of my life and I'm taking a stock why these things happen. Why am I in pain? Am I doing something wrong? What can be the answer to the question? The answer to the question can be I need to stop. I mean okay there are falls on my end or do I think there are falls on my end? I don't think so. If I'm not open to that question then the answer is obviously then things are pen out of my control right.\n\nsaid a lot in this prompt, maybe you want to give me responses on multiple headings, I can request sequentially. And we can go through and request them one after the other so that you can give me a detailed response if you think it's necessary. Or if you just want to give one response, it's fine. But let's not lose any depth that we can have that anything that is served here. If you think going through multiple headings will re-address the issues properly, let's do that.\n\n\n"
