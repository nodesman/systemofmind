Can I safely file this manager under terrible manager? He seemed to "be effective" in getting defects worked on  - his boss seemed to value him  enough to give hima  glowing goodbye. Was he particularly terrible? I've had terrible managers multiple of them 4 of the past 6 managers were horrible to me
