  "content": "that I want to work through with my so-called brother is the idea that he he hasn't he has made discriminatory remarks in the past or not discriminatory sorry I meant he has made down-putting comments judgmental things that at a young age I made the mistake of seeing him as a something of an authority or something of a person with some level of balance to perspective who's not crazy like my parents in the household it took me many many years of being away from them away from all of this to heal and see or see life for real to find out what is healthy and what is not healthy. Also I remember my mother making negative remarks about women in general and that also internalized into my system and something that I needed to learn to overcome. I'm not fully processed and managed to separate my mother's voice from my system but I think I made some progress. Clearly any lady that I deal with has to be kept away from, kept quite far from her.
