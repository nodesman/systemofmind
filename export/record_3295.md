Am i now to appraoch the \n\nWhy I am asking this is the horrific things I saw buffalo do how can one even intuit somethign like that? \n\nAm I being unfair for not wising up and forming a mental model of people and instead approach each with the same standard?\n\nWhat I am trying to ask is if I should infer the tendencies of people in the world and form a image and operate off that in relationships. It looks like I must. As I move through the world? Then what image doe i form of complete strangers? It caused me to feel uneasy as I was going through public who is going to attack me. That level of lack of trust. Why becuase of the shocking behavior I witnessed at work (you can ask me question on how did what happened at now lead me to worry about behavior of complete strangers at the lack of information and no image of people.. i guess in some sense we can assume the rule of law will sve us? but people have been killed for no reason at all ) \n\nIf we don't form inferences on people based on things done and said would you not be ignoring critical evidence. What seems on the surface small - like being stupid in some ways can become danger for you. right? \n\nHow can you as a LLM even tell me what to do in this? I mean i don't see you telling me yes raj you should be discerning of people and live forming a image of everyone. Then people change and if they do how do we discover the change - i guess i will if I managed to form a impression. There are lower stakes risks one can take to discover where one is. \n\n  I was betrayed by family. If I had the confidence to form this mental model may be I would have done something about all this. Even now I am resistant to form a image of my brother despite having 10 years of evidence of his behavior. I bring it up because such a forming of image would help predict some people's behavior but boy was buffalo's mindset so fucked up in ways I cannot comprehend. It is far outside the realm of comprehension - how can someone expect a report or any employee to fear another one for your convenience. \n\n\nWithin the context of this i want to ask two questions i guess: \n\n- Does everyone start with that framework\n- Does it seem like I didn not have such a framework of understanding - becuase buffalo made the discriminatory remark in 2022 august but i esclated it after i found it relevant (albeit after i went on sick leave and it came to the fore in 2023 october). i didn't even escalate buffalo in 2022 or even in first half of 2023 leading up to the incident. i put together the framework with HR-B but does it mean it was reactionary? but i was able to attribute motivation to why something was happening with snake.. but i didn't see what wsa goign on with buffalo because of a dearth of interaction. \n\nkeep in mind i wsa processing an insane number of things in my psyche. i realize now. even now i am processing them. answering questiosn. clarifying the way forward. i only processed buffalos discriminatory remark in august 2023 after being on sick leave..  \n\nPeople lie and say things, some facts some to put thoguhts in your mind to hurt you. so how do i attribute lies - we agreed that one can only determine how trustworthy someone is based on their ability to deliver on things. and doing what they say they will do.. that seems like an awful lot of judging to do for each person. but may be the judging is on a scale? am i now forming it because i;ve been through this and society in general operates from either cynical or naive one? what seems like usually happens that leads to people adopting a strategy? culture, experience? \n\n\n"
