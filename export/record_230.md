So this manipulative guy, as a life strategy, he is the same IC in our workplace, for example. He managed to manipulate, I don't know, this manager and him got aligned. So, is he taking a very high value strategy in life, by manipulating our events, by getting... I'm trying to ask if this person's strategy to life, he somehow managed to make the manager like him, right? That's a new, extremely naive girl, who had no assertiveness, who didn't know what was going on at work. I think he somehow managed to manipulate her into becoming his girlfriend. While he already had a girlfriend, he must have dumped her. That new girl is a product owner, and this guy was making product decisions. And I think he made a dependency on her, and also made moves on her, and somehow coerced her to accept his... I don't know, see, apparently he holds her hand at work. I don't know to what extent it's mutual, but he's a kind of ugly, disgusting guy. This girl is like 21 years old, this guy is 27 or something, 26, 27. And I'm just trying to understand or imagine, she's young, naive, and, you know, adventurous. Does it seem like this narcissistic IC who was supported by my manager and who got fired, who also, I said, that's why he died. So that girl is a bit pretty. So, he manipulated the situation to become some authority figure. And maybe that is why he managed to get the girl also. But he's ugly, and so I don't see him having succeeded with this girl under the circumstances. But I don't know, you know, what do you think? The manager was fired. Not this individual. The HR was saying they couldn't fire him because the director and others felt he was critical to some important project which he actually isn't. Technically.
