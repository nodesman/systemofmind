I just don't know what to call it because I am trying to see that i was in severe determinetal health which means I should have gone on sick leave immediately after March. But is this a lesson that can be carried over to tohers? like what is the lesson here? what would have happened had i been in the usa or india? do you follow - sure this is such a unusually unique situation.
