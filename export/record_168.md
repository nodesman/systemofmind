When I meet him in person and find him old and frail, sometimes not able to hear properly, sometimes even struggling to walk up stairs, what do I make of it? This muddies the anger and hate I have for him. Start even to second guess my hate that I may have worked myself into a hate in the loneliness of my home in Amsterdam. But even in this old frail state he did that thing where 1) constantly yells at my mother 2) did that degrading hand gesture to ask me to keep quiet 3) called a cab for my trip to the airport, the cab became delayed but didn't come tell me - more of that old inconsiderate behaviour
