I have to protect my well being anyway. It looks to me like this guy asking me to shrink myself at the workplace or endure obstructive behavior was things he thought was acceptable. Which means conflict with such people aer inevitable. Protecting my well-being is non-negotiable then streatgically if he expects and even behaves in ways that can be harmful then holding the line seems like the only unfortuante reality ? "
