Me:  If that too was too hopeful what would be the right one?

```You are absolutely right to question the "~2027+" estimate. While it's based on a simple, linear projection, it qualifies as "hopeful." A more realistic assessment, grounded in the current backlog data and the glacial movement of the visa bulletin, points to a significantly longer wait.

Let's call this the **"Structural Backlog" scenario**. It assumes no major legislative changes and is based on the hard math of visa supply and demand.

### The Realistic, More Pessimistic Green Card Timeline

For a **mid-to-late 2013 Priority Date (EB-2 India)**, a more probable green card approval timeframe is between **2030 and 2035**. Some analysts would argue even this is optimistic.

Here is the reasoning behind this much longer timeline.

#### 1. The Wall of Applicants (The Demand)

The core issue is the sheer volume of applicants ahead of you. As of late 2023, data suggested over 1.2 million individuals (including dependents) from India were in the employment-based green card queue. The vast majority are in the EB-2 and EB-3 categories.

For the visa date to move from January 2013 to August 2013, USCIS must first process green cards for every Indian applicant (and their families) who filed in those preceding seven months. This represents tens of thousands of people.

#### 2. The Trickle of Visas (The Supply)

Under current law, the U.S. issues a baseline of 140,000 employment-based green cards per year. A per-country cap limits any single country to 7% of the total, which is 9,800 visas. This 9,800 is for *all* employment-based categories combined (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3, etc.).

While some unused visas from other countries can "spill over" to India, the number available for EB-2 India annually is tragically lowâ€”often estimated at fewer than 5,000 visas. When you divide the "wall" of applicants by this "trickle" of visas, the wait time stretches into decades.

#### 3. The Absence of Forward Momentum (The Reality)

The most compelling evidence is the recent behavior of the visa bulletin itself.
* **Stagnation is the Norm:** For months at a time, the EB-2 India date has not moved at all.
* **Movement is Measured in Days:** When it does move, the advancement is often counted in single weeks or days. As of the latest bulletins in mid-2025, EB-2 India remains frozen at January 1, 2013, while EB-3 advanced by only one week.
* **Retrogression Risk:** If demand surges, dates can even move backward (retrogression), further extending the wait.

### Revised Green Card Projections (Mid-to-Late 2013 PD)

| Scenario | Estimated Approval | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stay in EB-2** | **~2032 - 2037** | To clear the 2013 backlog, the date must advance 12 months. At a rate of 1-2 months of progress per calendar year (a realistic, if painful, average), it would take 6-12 years from today (mid-2025) just to reach the end of 2013. This lands the approval firmly in the 2030s. |
| **Downgrade to EB-3** | **~2029 - 2033** | As of mid-2025, the EB-3 date is at April 2013. This gives you a slight advantage. However, as more people downgrade, the EB-3 date will also slow down dramatically. It might buy you a couple of years over staying in EB-2, but it is not a silver bullet. The approval is still likely to be near or after the turn of the decade. |

### The Bottom Line

If your alternate self had a **Priority Date in mid-to-late 2013**, the right way to think about it is not "When will I get my green card?" but rather "Will I get my green card this decade?"

The **~2027+ estimate was too hopeful.** Under the current legal framework, your alternate self would still be deep in the backlog today, looking at a wait that consumes the remainder of the 2020s and pushes well into the 2030s. This scenario illustrates the profound personal and professional impact of the per-country caps on Indian-born professionals.```
