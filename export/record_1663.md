So I put together something happening from days apart and from meetings and formed a picture of what is going on? And managed to have him fired based on this? And my testimony? Tell me in no uncertain words - My question - did I form a picture based on things that happened over 3 weeks and assign intent for each based on how they seemed etc? The disparate facts. 

So given that this individual was willing to throw my performance and create a perception of me losing my job with the intent of putting me in a state of fear to achieve his outcome of stopping the complaints from the IC - highly unethical indiscriminate and very harmful behaviour (imagine threatening your report with a knife almost for the issue coming up)? Is that what happened or may be you can disagree with me and come up with better wording.
