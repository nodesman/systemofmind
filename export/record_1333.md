Marriage as an Economic Gate\n\t•\tIn much of Indian society, marriage is not framed as two people choosing each other, but as an economic and social alliance between families.\n\t•\tA man is often expected to demonstrate financial stability (house, job, sometimes dowry or gifts).\n\t•\tWithout those markers, his chances of finding a partner are slim — even if he is otherwise decent or compatible.\n\nSo yes, the economic hurdle is real.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Social Filters Multiply the Hill\n\t•\tCaste, religion, region, and language narrow the pool, often far more than economics alone.\n\t•\tEven well-off men may face rejection if they don’t “fit” those boxes.\n\t•\tThis is why the “hill” isn’t only about money, but also about belonging to the right community context.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Imbalance in the Market\n\t•\tBecause of the skewed sex ratio (more men than women in the marriageable age group), the competition is intense.\n\t•\tWomen (and their families) can set high thresholds.\n\t•\tFor many men in rural India, marriage is delayed or never happens, creating a population of “involuntary bachelors.”\n\n⸻\n\n4. Contrast With the Basic Human Need\n\t•\tIf we think of pair-bonding as a basic human need, then yes: in India, that need is often mediated by a steep climb of economic, social, and family demands.\n\t•\tIn theory, falling in love should be “ordinary.” In practice, many men (and women too, in different ways) face a gated path.\n\n⸻\n\n5. But Not the Whole Story\n\t•\tIn urban, educated India, dating apps and more relaxed norms are flattening the hill somewhat.\n\t•\tStill, even there, expectations (career, lifestyle, “modern but traditional” balance) make it less of a flat field than in, say, much of Western Europe.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ So:\nIt’s true. For many Indians, especially men, access to partnership is not just about attraction or affection — it’s an economic and social obstacle course. The “ordinary human thing” of finding a mate has been turned into a hill climb, largely because of family-centric marriage, caste rules, and economic pressure.\n```\n\nDo you agree with the above statement from GPT-5? If you were to not become too anchored by the question's framing would you agree or not. But then is it true that women in Netherlands do not marry at least sideways? Or is it definitely a phenomenon in India (and china?)  \n"
