  "content": "Short answer: you don’t “out‑argue” a Deflector/Exploiter; you expose the pattern, constrain it with structure, and document it so others can see what you already feel. Here’s a practical playbook.\n\n1) Fast detection heuristics (early tells)\n- Vague claims, no specifics: can’t give dates, names, artifacts when asked (who/what/when/where/how).\n- Asymmetric standards: high demands on you, “special context” for them/their favorite.\n- Pre-emptive framing: “Let’s agree speed > quality” before any discussion; sets the win condition.\n- Triangulation: prefers side chats; resists joint meetings with all parties present.\n- Process pedantry: weaponizes minor rules when it helps them; ignores them when it hurts them.\n- Pseudo-apologies: “I’m sorry you feel that way,” never “I did X; here’s how I’ll fix it.”\n- Ownership voids: in any failure story, everyone else is agentic; they’re a victim of circumstance.\n- Boundary allergy: normal, polite no’s trigger guilt, anger, or escalation.\n\n2) In-conversation “pattern traps” (force contradictions into the open)\n- Specificity funnel: “Can you give one concrete example? When? Who was present? What was the impact?”\n- Steelman test: “Can you summarize my concern in your own words?” (Deflectors can’t represent you fairly.)\n- Success-criteria lock: “What would success look like next week? What will you do? By when?”\n- Two-way ownership: “Name one thing you will change,” written down. (Watch for deflection.)\n- Triangulation jam: “Let’s get all three of us on the same call,” then book it in the room.\n- SBI framework: “Situation-Behavior-Impact” stated calmly; ask for response to the behavior only.\n- Timeboxing anti-filibuster: “We have 10 minutes; let’s choose: option A, B, or C?” (Reduces rambling.)\n- Fact-lock recap: send a same-day summary email: “We agreed X (owner, date). Reply if inaccurate.”\n\n3) Documentation & artifacts (your leverage)\n- Decision log: date, topic, decision, owners, due dates. Share widely.\n- Evidence bank: emails/DMs, meeting minutes, tickets, commit history, calendars. Keep originals.\n- Consistency matrix: put their statements side-by-side across time/channels to show flip-flops.\n- Pattern log: repeated behaviors > incidents. 3+ similar entries makes the case for HR/leadership.\n- Written recaps after every ambiguous conversation. Silence = tacit agreement later.\n\n4) Structural controls (contain the behavior)\n- RACI/owner assignments: names next to deliverables; “the team” can’t be blamed.\n- Joint channels: move “private nudges” into shared rooms; default to public threads for decisions.\n- Gate of specifics: no change without a written brief (problem, evidence, options, risks).\n- Meeting design: agenda, timeboxes, notes, decisions captured live; yours if no one else’s.\n- Metrics before judgment: agree on objective criteria in advance; no retroactive goal changes.\n\n5) Escalation ladder (when to move up)\n- Tier 1: boundary + specificity request. (“Please keep this in the project channel. One example?”)\n- Tier 2: written recap & owner lock. (Confirms commitments; establishes a record.)\n- Tier 3: bring a neutral in the room. (Manager/HR/mediator; no more one-on-ones.)\n- Tier 4: formal complaint packet. (Chronology, exhibits, policy/code-of-conduct mapping, impact.)\n- Tier 5: exit/transfer with record. (If leadership protects the pattern, protect yourself.)\n\n6) Personal context (family/close)\n- One-trial boundary: set a small boundary; watch for guilt/anger/minimization (predictive).\n- Apology test: real = ownership + change + no repeats. Pseudo = “sorry you feel.”\n- Reciprocity ledger: are asks > gives over time? If yes, go low contact + transactional.\n- No emergency role: don’t be the emotional regulator or scapegoat; refuse triangulation.\n- “No private decisions”: big topics only in group settings or in writing with summaries.\n\n7) What not to do\n- Don’t debate feelings vs feelings. Anchor to facts, artifacts, and agreed criteria.\n- Don’t stay in private channels. Sunlight is both disinfectant and memory.\n- Don’t accept endless “context.” Ask for the behavior, impact, and the change.\n- Don’t aim for a gotcha. Aim for clarity, containment, and a record.\n\n8) Quick scripts you can reuse\n- “Happy to address—could you share one concrete example (date, message) so we can fix the right thing?”\n- “Let’s capture owners and dates so we don’t lose it.”\n- “This belongs in the project channel so everyone can see/align.”\n- “Summarizing our decisions: A (you), B (me), due Fri. Reply if anything’s off.”\n- “I’m not comfortable discussing X without Y present. Let’s schedule the three of us.”\n\nCore idea: you “catch” a deflector/exploiter by denying them darkness (private ambiguity), denying them fog (vagueness), and denying them fungibility (no one is “the team”—there are named owners, dates, and artifacts). You don’t need a confession; you need a pattern that others can see."
