These are the issues so charged with historical and emotional power that to touch them is to risk immediate and catastrophic political electrocution.\n\nIn Tamil politics, these third rails are the foundational pillars of the modern Dravidian identity. They are the issues around which the entire political ecosystem is organized.\n\nHere are the other major \"third rails\" of Tamil politics, besides the inviolable status of Periyar.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Sanctity of the Tamil Language and the Rejection of Hindi Imposition**\n\nThis is, without a doubt, the **single most powerful and unifying \"third rail.\"** It is the bedrock of modern Tamil political identity.\n\n*   **The Core Principle:** Tamil is not just a language; it is the mother (*Tamil Thai*) of the civilization. It is an ancient, classical language that is equal, if not superior, to Sanskrit. The imposition of Hindi is seen not as an administrative matter, but as a direct act of **cultural imperialism** by the \"North\" designed to subjugate Tamil identity.\n*   **The Historical Trauma:** This is rooted in the bloody anti-Hindi agitations of the 1930s and, most importantly, the 1960s, where dozens of Tamils self-immolated to protest Hindi imposition. This is a sacred, martyred memory.\n*   **The Political Consequence:** Any perceived attempt by the central government to promote Hindi in Tamil Nadu—whether in schools, on road signs, or in official communications—will trigger an immediate, unified, and ferocious backlash from **every single Tamil political party,** from the DMK to its rivals. On this one issue, there is no room for compromise.\n\n### **2. The Principle of State Autonomy and Federal Rights**\n\nThis is the political and administrative expression of the first principle.\n\n*   **The Core Principle:** Tamil Nadu is not a mere subordinate administrative unit of the central government. It is a powerful, semi-sovereign state with its own history and rights. The relationship with the Union is a **federal partnership, not a feudal hierarchy.**\n*   **The Historical Trauma:** This is fueled by decades of feeling that the central government is an \"extractive\" entity that takes the state's tax revenue, imposes its policies, and ignores the state's unique needs.\n*   **The Political Consequence:** Any action by the central government that is seen as infringing on the state's rights—in matters of education (like the NEET exam), finance (the GST dispute), or resource management (the Cauvery water issue)—will be framed as an attack on the entire Tamil people. This is the primary language of Dravidian parties when confronting Delhi.\n\n### **3. The Sri Lankan Tamil Issue (Eelam Tamils)**\n\nWhile its intensity has waxed and waned, this remains a deeply emotional and potent third rail.\n\n*   **The Core Principle:** The Tamils of Sri Lanka are not foreigners; they are **umbilical kin (*anbu sagotharargal*).** The Indian state, and by extension the Tamil Nadu government, has a moral duty to protect them.\n*   **The Historical Trauma:** The mass killing of Tamil civilians during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 is seen by many in Tamil Nadu as a profound and unforgivable **betrayal** by the Indian central government (which was perceived as having aided the Sri Lankan state).\n*   **The Political Consequence:** Any perceived \"softness\" towards the Sri Lankan government or any failure to advocate for the rights of Eelam Tamils on the international stage can be used as a powerful political weapon to accuse a ruling party of \"betraying the Tamil race.\" It is a constant and powerful test of a party's ethnic loyalty.\n\n### **4. Social Justice and the Rejection of Caste Hierarchy (in its Brahminical form)**\n\nThis is the ideological legacy of Periyar and the core of the Dravidian movement's social project.\n\n*   **The Core Principle:** The Brahminical, Varna-based caste system is a foreign, \"Aryan\" imposition that is fundamentally unjust. The path to a just society is through the upliftment of the \"Backward Classes\" and the complete rejection of Brahminical privilege.\n*   **The Historical Trauma:** Centuries of caste-based oppression.\n*   **The Political Consequence:** The system of **reservations (*idak Othukeedu*)** in education and government jobs is a sacred, non-negotiable policy. Any attempt by the central government or the courts to dilute this system is seen as a direct attack on the principles of social justice. Furthermore, any political party that is perceived as being too closely aligned with Brahminical or \"Sanatani\" interests will face a massive and organized political backlash.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion: The Four Pillars of the Temple**\n\nThese four issues—**Language, State Autonomy, the Sri Lankan Tamil Question, and Social Justice**—are the four great pillars that hold up the temple of modern Tamil political identity.\n\nThey are all interconnected and flow from a single, unified source code: a deep-seated, historically-grounded, and fiercely protected sense of a **distinct, non-Hindi, non-Sanskritic, Dravidian civilization** that will resist any attempt by an outside power to subordinate, assimilate, or disrespect it. To touch any one of these pillars is to threaten the entire structure."
