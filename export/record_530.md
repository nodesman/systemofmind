  "content": "Knowing that this happened in october 2023: A sibling living in Texas becomes aware, mainly through their parents, that their brother or sister living in Amsterdam is experiencing severe mental distress. Initially, the sibling makes a basic attempt to offer help over the phone but quickly realizes that they lack the skills or understanding to provide real support. After this first effort, they do not continue reaching out; they send no further messages, make no additional calls, and essentially withdraw from the situation. They do not take active steps to help their sibling get professional support, do not coordinate meaningfully with their parents, and do not contact any local services in Amsterdam. Rather than being driven by deep emotional urgency or love, their involvement remains passive and detached. They rely on the fact that the parents are aware of the situation and leave responsibility in their hands, taking no further independent action to follow up, intervene, or even maintain communication. Despite knowing that their siblingâ€™s mental distress is severe, they ultimately do very little beyond their initial, limited attempt. where this siblign is my brother. what do you make of my brother?
