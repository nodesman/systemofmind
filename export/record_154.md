I also don't understand his thinking. How did he think that he would continue to get it till he he would be able to treat us like this for the rest of his life? Or did he not think that there will be consequences? What does it look like? I mean, is giving him consequences for his behavior in the past 30 years unfair? Have I also been tolerated in that sense?
