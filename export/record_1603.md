I'm pretty sure the manager was fired. They didn't tell me explicitly, but his timing of firing is a timing of so-called retirement seems unusual because after all he did okay fine one is what all he did second is he has a Brazilian or American passport he says he's moving to Spain and lives there I bet on a non-local visa I think this is what I think it's not no one told me this so I'm just trying to say okay shortly after the investigation report came out news came out that he retired he's also just about 50 years old if you have to retire you have to get money from somewhere right is he a millionaire I don't know can people have a lot of money to the amount of being able to retire but be working as software engineers I don't know you tell me you assume he worked for 27 years and he managed to secure enough funds to from his many years as a software engineer thing manager he even worked in some company and apparently he has some eight-year-old or nine-year-old child or seven-year-old child and when he when the child was born he was struggling to pay his pay his medical bills and he sold all the stock and then he was able to meet that. I'm trying to ask if the reasoning for me concluding he was fired seems reasonable.
