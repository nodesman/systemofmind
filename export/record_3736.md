Go into it along the axes we originally disucssed:\n\n```\nA “live and let live” culture is a social attitude or ethos where people accept that others may have different values, lifestyles, or beliefs, and they choose not to interfere as long as those differences don’t cause direct harm.\n\nIt’s grounded in mutual tolerance and non-interference. The key ideas are:\n\t•\tPersonal freedom: Everyone is entitled to live their life as they see fit.\n\t•\tBoundaries: Your freedom ends where it starts infringing on someone else’s.\n\t•\tPragmatism over judgment: Even if you disagree with how someone lives, you refrain from imposing your way on them.\n\t•\tSocial peace: Coexistence is prioritized over conformity.\n\nThis kind of culture tends to emerge in pluralistic societies where people of varied backgrounds live together. For instance, the Dutch gedogen policy (a pragmatic tolerance where certain activities are technically illegal but socially accepted) is often cited as an example of a “live and let live” attitude in practice.\n\nWould you like me to sketch how this differs from tolerance, which is similar but not exactly the same?\n```\nIf you can go into each with examples of where the deviation is with examples of in what siutations this usually manifests that would be great\n"
