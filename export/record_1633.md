The HR knows the full unfiltered truth of what happened -every single thing including the fact that I reached out to him for getting help with something becoming toxic and him putting it in the 1-1 notes that "Raj caleld the dynamics to be toxic which is unfortunate but we cannot change meetings for one person's personal preferences" when I said a retrospective had to be split up and potentially we need to discuss before having the retrospective due to toxiicty 0 but i sent this as an email to the product manager who arranged said meeting and they seemed to have identified it as a failure on his part and that i should have contacted HR at that point . They told me in June 2024 that I should have reached out ot HR if your manager was not willing to help. 

My question apart fom the statements above: what would they(HR) ahve seen in teh manager?

Do you think he really "retierd" or something else really happened? Given the gravity of all that we know?
