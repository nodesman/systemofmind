I am not asking if this was all worth it i am asking what the life had I continued to say in India hve been - the core question I am dealing with is AIEEE was a tough exam as hell to get a half decent college called VIT and then most of those people seem to go to a bottom of the barrel place like TCS or at best Microsoft and if you had started out with a life as a RBI ward then what was the up side?
