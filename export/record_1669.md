What could he mean knowing that he got he lost his job okay he did this pattern in the first day he told me that when he threw the litany of complaints he told me we would rather work with you than to work with someone else as if to keep me from quitting does that mean he genuinely hoped I would not take it too hard and end up quitting is a situation that went out of his control was that then done with the so-called good intentions and knowing how it ended how we how the HR person said if she told me that doing someone on PIP is a one-year effort and you need to have an excel file and you need to have specific numbers and only then you can be placed on PIP and even before that they'll try to just have a discussion with you and try to secure an MTA instead of trying to put you on PIP is what she said what do you think I mean knowing this does that mean he did not seek to fire me but was hoping to blackmail me and hoping the problem will go away but things got out of hand and he got fired? He never spoke to HR about any pip is that what this indicates? Which means he may have pursued that had he known how things will go?
