**User:**
can you point to the parts in my prompt that indicated this detail:

"Ownership and Entitlement
He seems to have believed he owned you"

How did you derive this from my prompts -can you point to it? Don't take my assertions - but see if it makes sense by putting together a picture. Please do not take my explicit statements to the effect as evidence. Would you change your earlier answer if that was the case? I am not happy that this has somehow anchored the previous response. Please derive for me a more balanced first principles answer by first finding evidence for teh afore mentioend and then trying to derive a fresh answer by putting the evidence together again. If that comes together as ownership?
