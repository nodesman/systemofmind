If I had slightly brown hair, chocolate brown hair, and I had highlights as a man, Indian man, and I went around well-groomed, well-dressed, and I went around the world, USA, China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, India, what would be the experience and reactions and things that people think? And I know things would not be so nice in India for that, but go on. But I don't know. Look, I don't know, I don't want to anchor you, but maybe start from fresh. How would it be perceived in India and all the other countries i've mentioned, given what we know about the culture?
