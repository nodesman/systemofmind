I wish I said \"Apologies, claudia. I didn't mean to put the burden of being a arbiter of truth. ServiceNow's evetual liabilities remain what they are regardless of who you choose to speak to. Keep in mind that this who investigation is kicked off by what I witnessed and rests on the credibility of my testimony.
