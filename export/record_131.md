The things that I want to work through are specifically the extremely abusive household that I live in. Previously I thought this person who used to be my father or who is my father is a misguided person who is an otherwise providing father who otherwise meant well but that is not true. He was demeaning and dismissive and actively harmful I think and what I'm trying to achieve is an accurate image of him allows me to close I mean understand him fully rather than I want to have a fair but fair and realistic understanding of what happened so that I can close the book on him, grieve it and overcome the pain and suffering that I am likely working through or rather I have the effects of. One of the things that I think that may have happened are the shaming that he did about after reading my diary which may have impacted me severely in the area of intimacy and such. The current conversation that I'm having now should actually help me clarify this idea if it is true that he wasn't just a bad father with a rude demeanor he was someone who was actively harmful. To what extent is this true? Please don't respond yet I will respond I will ask for a response later.
