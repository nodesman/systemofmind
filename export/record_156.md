So it looks like the anger stems from being acutely aware of me seeing how I deserve to be treated better but he treated me much worse than that. So that is keeping me angry. How does one get past that? How does my self-esteem is causing problem for, is causing pain? I felt this guy, he was really really just always, always nasty, indecent, coarse. So how does one move forward from that?
