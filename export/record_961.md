I seem to have also had trumatic incidents in my 20s and when i got mrried i was able to put focus int o emgiration. i received tehreapy but not medication in the form of anti-depressants until my late 30s after natualization becausegetting medication seems to have been difficult in europe so i had compelxt trauam awhich led to my divorce happening due to realtions problems between me and the ex-wife as well as her own immaturity and her parents' interference. and me being able to have sex with anyone at all other than my ex-wife. more nervous with my ex-wife. so what do i make of it? i have secured the life here. so i am in a limbo and pain that i seem to be in a confluence of causes and effects "
