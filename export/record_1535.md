I've been on sick leave and have been interacting with HR via my personal email address. They emailed the MTA proposal to my official email address which since my sick leave they're known to not email after they found out that I previously found unpleasant to check. Since then they've been emailing my personal email but somehow the HR person emailed me the proposal after my second round of negotiation. After first rejection. They later emailed me 9 days later stating they will give me one more day and I didn't open the email. On the day of the deadline they gave me another reminder asking me to respond. 

To me or looks like there was an attempt at prevent me having time for contemplation and avoid another back and forth. In that sense. In the previous negotiation they did send all communication to my personal email address. I'm wondering if this is a manipulative exploding offer. But in the end it kind of didn't work or may be it did slightly. I don't know. I open opened their second reminder email on the day of the deadline with email D saying I hadn't seen their original email A and only the reminder email R sent to me 9 days after A. At which point they told me they wil give me 4 more days "given my note below". I didn't open email R because I didn't want to pollute my mind at 9pm. I even disabled notifications for some reason 1 hour before the email R arrived. I didn't open the email after I saw it today day at ,9pm preventing the opportunity to manipulate me into a exploding offer. I inadvertent forced them to send email D on the deadline and give me more time. I remember the night before the day I sent my asking offer 6 days before the day A was sent - I was crying hoping they won't negotiate again. What do you think of this whole affair? Was I manipulated or did they try to? Did I inadvertently not fall for it or what was the impact of me not seeing the email R on the day and only responding to D.
