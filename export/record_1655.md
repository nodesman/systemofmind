I told HR about the taunting as well and surely they saw the huge red flaw when I asked a similar question to the Linkedin post that he reported to HR having occured in company chat directly.  My question I guess is - what do you think they saw with that additional context and all the toher things? 

So did I really notice 2 parallel things and put together a complex synergy of mutliple events into a pattern ? Such a complex thing to build in the brain right? Events from across days. Why they seemed to be done. What seems credible, what doesn't. Or am I gloating too much? Be realistic - did I combine imagery from multiple events that most people would not have noticed or remembered? No matter how I word it it sounds self gloating - give me a balanced answer
