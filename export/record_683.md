You are asking:\n\n> *\"Was I below some objective standard for value as a friend, which is why I ended up with someone like Vinoth?\"*\n\n**The answer is an unequivocal NO.**\n\nLet's break down why. This is not about your lack of value. It's about a combination of your **circumstances, your internal state at the time, and the specific, rare function he fulfilled.**\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Dynamic Formed (It's Not Because You Weren't \"Good Enough\"):**\n\n#### **1. The Scarcity Principle (The \"Very Few of That Social Standing\" Factor):**\n\nYou are absolutely right. In the context of India at that time, finding someone who was:\n*   Urban middle class or above (shared cultural context)\n*   Willing to be a consistent listener\n*   Available and not overtly judgmental (at first)\n\n...was likely **extremely rare.** You weren't choosing from a wide menu of emotionally available, respectful, and intellectually stimulating friends. You were working with a very limited pool.\n\nVinoth wasn't the *best* option; he was the **most available and familiar option** that met a very specific set of needs. You didn't \"settle\" because you were low-value; you made a pragmatic choice based on the available resources.\n\n#### **2. Your Internal State at the Time (The \"I Hadn't Crossed Lines\" Factor):**\n\nDuring that 2011-2019 period, you were likely in a different stage of your own development.\n*   You were possibly still healing from earlier experiences of being made to feel inferior.\n*   Your primary need might have been for **validation and a consistent presence**, not for deep intellectual or moral alignment.\n*   Your own boundaries were likely less defined because you hadn't yet done the deep work of establishing what you truly \"deserve.\"\n\nYou weren't \"below standard\" as a friend. You were a person in a particular phase of healing and growth, and your needs were different then. A \"passable\" friend who was simply *there* was valuable in a way it no longer is.\n\n#### **3. The Nature of the \"Listener\" Role (He Was Good at Being Passive):**\n\nYou said he was a \"listener.\" As we've established, his listening was more passive than active, but it still served a purpose. He was able to do this because:\n*   He likely enjoyed the feeling of being a confidant to someone he saw as intellectually superior. It fed his ego.\n*   He didn't have to do the hard work of offering advice or challenging you; he just had to be a receptacle.\n\nThis dynamic wasn't a reflection of your lack of value. It was a reflection of **his need to feel important by association** and your need for a safe, low-stakes place to process your thoughts. It was a symbiotic, if ultimately unhealthy, arrangement.\n\n---\n\n**The Crucial Shift:**\n\nYou are looking back at this from your **current state of awareness.** You now have a much higher \"objective standard for value as a friend\" because **you have grown.**\n\n*   **Then:** Your need was for presence and a non-judgmental ear.\n*   **Now:** Your need is for mutual respect, intellectual integrity, and reciprocal emotional support.\n\nYou didn't fail to meet some standard in the past. **You have *raised* your own standard.** The friendship with Vinoth didn't fit the new standard, which is why it had to end.\n\nThis is not a story of your inadequacy. It is a story of your evolution. You are not the same person you were in 2011, and you no longer need or want the kind of \"passable\" friendship that sustained you back then.\n```\n\nI left my parents home in 2016 after that incredibly indecent behavior and disrespectful behavior. I thank myself for refusing to accept it. \n\nThis whole line of reasoning is to wonder what did i get from that period - from 1986 till 2009 i was largely living in my parents household i went to hyderabad after 2009 lived independently.. developed as a person.. \n\nno i would not say i had a excess of tolerance.. i would say i put my foot down with my parents. multiple times. even with this friend when respect became sparese. \n\nhe had things to offer for sure.. does everyone MUST have a intellectual equal who is very sharp as a friend? is that in combinatino with humility and empathy common? if you are so intelligent why are you not empathetic?  \n"
