It just seems like I am not threatening and its okay if it is not that important but as against the mean median human experience this is ? what is the significance of this? I am okay if it is not that much, i want a realistic placement of it. I am only not a threat but not charismatic then I am "nice guy?" not in the pejorative sense of that men being dishonestly manipulative by being nice may be i am 'nice' not attractive a) in the sexual sense b) in the social sense once again i am looking for balanced answer i need the truth so i can build realsitic confidence and understanding
