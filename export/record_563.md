I didn't chose the culture or parents i grew up with. The forced arranged marriage and the things that were said and done at the time were extremely harmful. I think this somatic work through of the issue is highly relevant. It explains why my divorce happened and i could not succeed but i think the basis is stll correct - i from first hand expereince i can see that indian womena are not safe. and a indian family is going to do what for me? recreate a dysfunctional and nasty script into whch i will have to attach myself of someone else's indian family"
