  "content": "We used to have a lifetime of feudalism with an average lifespan of about 30-40 years. \n\nThen we had nukes, then we discovered and started using fossil fuels. \n\nYou're saying fossil fuels contributed to a world that led to the nuclear weapon that led to a world of nuclear safety and therefore a world of long peace. \n\nwe invented microprocessors which led to computers which led to ever faster computers until we are now at the point where we are at LLMs. \n\nThere is a sentence that is made that combines never before combined ideas. \n\nThe economy is defined as us buying and selling things to each other and paying taxes. \n\nMoney is a proxy for time spent making something. Money is nearly fully a proxy for value or for for the value of something that is spent creating it. Money in one country gets you further than money in another one. \n\nThe west is mostly deindustrialized. Relies on china and will likely forever rely on it. May hedge by doing manufaturing in india, vietname and phillipines. \n\nMoney seems to flow from one to the ohter inventing new phenomenon. And to a large extent slowly it is all digital. But still there are mattresss companies sure. there are lumber companies sure. \n\nHowever the population of the west is falling rapidly. \n\nA lot many jobs that used to be done by people will be AI assisted. Sure that will entail new jobs. I guess. Really? \n\nI guess in some sense the new jobs will involve weilding AI tools. And there is a fortune to be made in makig those tools that are a bit of a skill and are sold as skills.\n\nSure at some point may be we will enter a world of abundance where AI will produce food. Ai will may be even make furniture. I do not see AI ever being abel to drive cars. Ever no matter how much they try to gaslight us. I won't buy it. The theory is we will go towards a world of doing greater things. But greater what things? All things we do are geared towards one thing - making human life more and more comfortable, long and enjoyable. We can have an abundance of things eventually. But in the end we are only going to be on earth. It is not like all of our efforts are going ot be about becoming a space faring civilization. That is in anyway not a future for all of us - is it? Is it a given that that is the future? We will colonize some new planet and then make a passenger movie like spacecraft to leave the solar system to go oanother star system. That too will be probably aboard a space craft. \n\nIt really does seem like we've hit the end of what can be a higher leverage activity. If AI takes all jobs it is going ot be a problem. In any case .. whateve effort is involved in becoming multi-planetary will be a act of moving consciousness and not individuals. So in regards to the short term future What comes next after we have hit peak AI? better and better AI leads to what? UBI and just chill life? Because ultimately not all of us are on the space faring effort. Most space faring efforts are minimally funded. Wars seem far more funded for no reason. I ugess geopolitics is what the economy will be about? how does AI help with that? Will government say we dont need people and we dont care if you reproduce and AI will do the creationg for us and therefore we have all the power we need? Money is also irrelevant and now we have to create a parallel economy of the peoplw with a currency that excahnges for 1 of theirs in the billions? \n\nI sound like a conspiracy nut. I am just trying ot see where the world is going in the next 30-50 years. That's all. Where are we going? What kind of a world are we going to. Is labor irrelevant in this new world. Knkowelge work will remain relevant for a long time. I guess. But we will go up and and up the chain. May be that is where the fortunes are to be made. In paving the path up the chain. \n\nBut what are your thoughts?\n"
