And? \n\nThis consistency seeking behavior makes sense.. that is why i was not able to have sex with my wife or any indian women at all who were accessible through the indian traditional script or is stuck in that. I was told to avoid women so avoided women and represed myself with women. suddenl doing that with her was not possible while also privately. \n\ni see no conclusion other than indian society is highly hazardous to me. and even innately. all the narratives seem anti-human.. the way people are innately treated is bad. \n\n\n"
