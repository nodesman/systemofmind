A Catastrophic Business or Technical Failure Coupled with Dishonesty.**\n\n*   **Examples:** A major product launch fails spectacularly due to his negligence, and it is discovered that he **lied about the status or the risks** to his superiors. A massive data breach or system outage occurs, and it is traced back to his gross incompetence or his decision to ignore repeated warnings from his team.\n*   **Why it's so fast:** This is not just a failure of competence; it is a failure of **integrity.** The lying is more important than the failure itself. It proves he cannot be trusted.\n\n\nGiven that it is a premium plugin and not a fundamnetal plugin. What could possibly have happened?\n"
