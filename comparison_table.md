| Aspect                  | Inherited-Static System (The "Fundamentalist")                                | Inherited-Dynamic System (The "Reformer" / "Lawyer")                                                                                             |

| **Foundational Axioms** | **STATIC:** The core text/script is sacred, literal, and unchangeable truth.   | **STATIC:** The core text/script is sacred, absolute, and unchangeable truth.                                                                    |
| **Interpretation Method** | **STATIC:** Literal and historical. The meaning is fixed and was set long ago. | **DYNAMIC:** Metaphorical, allegorical, and creative. The meaning is fluid and can be re-interpreted to fit the context of the modern world.         |
| **Approach to Novelty** | **STATIC:** Rejects the novelty. If the new situation is not explicitly covered by the text, it is forbidden, irrelevant, or must be forced into an old category. | **DYNAMIC:** Engages the novelty. The new situation is a puzzle to be solved by finding a clever, non-contradictory application of the sacred text. |
| **Mechanism for Change** | **STATIC:** Change is heresy. The system only changes through schism or collapse when external reality becomes completely untenable. | **DYNAMIC:** Change is reform. The system evolves through brilliant legal arguments, new interpretations, and progressive revelations that keep the core text relevant. |
| **Primary Skillset**    | **STATIC:** Memorization, recitation, and enforcement of established dogma.      | **DYNAMIC:** Scholarship, argumentation, debate, and creative interpretation.                                                                    |
| **Source of Truth**     | **STATIC:** The explicit *letter* of the law.                                 | **DYNAMIC:** The implied *spirit* of the law, discovered through intellectual effort.                                                            |
| **Boundary of Thought** | **STATIC:** Cannot question the literal truth of the foundational text.         | **STATIC:** Cannot question the foundational text's status as the ultimate source of truth.                                                      |
| **Analogy**             | A rigid constitutional originalist who believes the text only means what it meant in 1789. | A brilliant constitutional lawyer who believes the text is a "living document" that can be adapted to govern the internet.                     |
