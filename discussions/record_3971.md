Are you saying that path one would have been stay in India and path two is he decided to become an Indian-American? And path three is me going all into this thing. Okay, firstly, I need to reconcile that path one with path three, with my own chosen path three. I have to let path three win and validate it. There are some path ones in conflict with my path three. So as I derived dynamic at an earlier point in life, I decided to change where I live. See the confusion, I'm not able to move past this. I changed my first, I chose India to stay in India. Then I moved away from India because it was not good for my long-term future. So I'm just thinking that, see, I'm not able to place path three or derived dynamic with my choice of immigration. See that, when we say a path, we're talking about, so yeah, Netherlands is not just good enough, but the absolute best possible place to have been in the world, where would it have been? Maybe Switzerland, I don't know, maybe. Little better would have been Switzerland, I guess. No, low taxes. I'm not even sure about that, to be honest. What I am trying to tell you is I'm not able to place what about me or where is the boundary of my path three decision to leave India and who is it in conflict with, who is bothered by it? Or who should I keep it from? I mean, so far, the only person who seems to have a major problem with it is me because even my brother who's in the US is jealous of me.\n\nMy hair coloring is perhaps against who how do I how do I come to the it's a go to a conference about Indian political something something in India and there are there are urban Indians and I'm have a colored hair with highlights or do I see it and then what is the overall dynamic path three and I will make continue to make new choices I may make more choices that are going to disconnect which means I'll create more boundaries from more people right with mostly Indians mostly people from my past correct or no but the I mean in terms of dynamic is it true that all not all decisions that you change can be kept that way and if that is the case over time people you had boundaries with will not you will remove those boundaries later now that you have changed it\n"
