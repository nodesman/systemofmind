# The Three Temporal Spectrums

For each of the three "Temporal" variables, the two options are not binary choices. They are the two extreme ends of a continuous spectrum. Most people do not live at the absolute poles. They live somewhere in the messy, complex middle.

Let's re-define the variables as spectrums, not as binary choices.

### Variable 1: The "Discount Rate" Spectrum

*   **The Spectrum:**
    `High Time Preference (Impulsive) <----------------------> Low Time Preference (Architect)`
*   **The "Values" on the Spectrum:**
    *   **The Pure Impulsive (10/10):** A person who almost always chooses immediate gratification (e.g., a gambling addict).
    *   **The "Live for the Weekend" Person (7/10):** A common modern archetype. They endure the work week for the pleasure of the weekend.
    *   **The Balanced Pragmatist (5/10):** A person who is good at balancing saving for the future with enjoying the present.
    *   **The "Architect" (2/10):** A person who is highly oriented towards long-term gain, but is still capable of enjoying the present.
    *   **The Pure Ascetic (0/10):** A person who sacrifices all present pleasure for a future goal (e.g., an extreme religious ascetic).

### Variable 2: The "Temporal Horizon" Spectrum

*   **The Spectrum:**
    `Short Temporal Horizon (Firefighter) <----------------------> Long Temporal Horizon (Grandmaster)`
*   **The "Values" on the Spectrum:**
    *   **The Pure Firefighter (10/10):** A person who is only capable of reacting to the crisis of the present moment.
    *   **The "Quarterly Thinker" (6/10):** A typical corporate manager. Their planning horizon is limited to the next financial quarter.
    *   **The "Five-Year Planner" (4/10):** A standard, responsible adult.
    *   **The "Grandmaster" (1/10):** A person who thinks in terms of decades and generations.
    *   **The "Geological Thinker" (0/10):** A rare philosopher or scientist who thinks in terms of millennia.

### Variable 3: The "Relationship to the Past" Spectrum

*   **The Spectrum:**
    `"Haunted" by the Past (The Ghost) <----------------------> "Learning" from the Past (The Historian)`
*   **The "Values" on the Spectrum:**
    *   **The Pure Ghost (10/10):** A person who is completely trapped in a trauma loop, unconsciously re-enacting the same self-destructive patterns.
    *   **The "Nostalgist" (7/10):** A person who lives in a romanticized and often inaccurate version of their own past.
    *   **The "Pragmatic Learner" (4/10):** A person who learns from their most obvious mistakes but doesn't engage in a deep, systemic deconstruction.
    *   **The "Sovereign Historian" (1/10):** A person who treats their entire past as a data set to be rigorously and unsentimentally analyzed to build better models for the future.
