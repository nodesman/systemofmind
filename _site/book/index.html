<p><strong>A guide to the invisible systems that drive people, and how to navigate them for a safer life.</strong></p>

<p>This book is an examination of the “Default Settings”—the mental maps—that individuals use to navigate the world. It is a compass, not a ladder. It does not argue that one way of life is inherently superior to another. Instead, it reveals the fundamental trade-offs that come with each of the three primary Default Settings.</p>

<p>By understanding this model, you can identify your own position, understand the people around you, and decide if the trade-offs you are making are the ones you truly want to make.</p>
