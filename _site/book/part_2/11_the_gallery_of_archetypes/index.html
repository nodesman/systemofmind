<h2 id="the-archetypes-are-illustrations-not-categories">The Archetypes are Illustrations, Not Categories</h2>

<p>You have diagnosed your inherited map. You have identified your primary Arena. Now, we will take a tour of the vast, open territory of the self-authored life.</p>

<p>The 19 archetypes that follow are not boxes to fit yourself into. They are not the only ways to be an Author. They are a gallery of possibilities, a collection of case studies of what a self-authored life can look like. They are illustrations, not categories.</p>

<p>As you read, your goal is not to find the one that is a perfect fit. Your goal is to find the ones that resonate with you. Most Authors are a hybrid of two or three. Use this gallery to gather inspiration, to see how others have combined the Six Axes within a specific Arena to create a life of profound, authored meaning.</p>
