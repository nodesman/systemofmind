# The Oracle's Chamber

Here, you consult your own deepest wisdom. When faced with a dilemma, bring it to the Oracle. The Oracle is your ratified constitution. Its purpose is not to give you answers, but to force you to reason through your situation based on the principles *you* have defined.

### Your Ratified Constitution:
<div class="output">
    <h4>Core Virtues:</h4>
    <ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Bright Lines:</h4>
    <ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Definition of "Winning":</h4>
    <p></p>
</div>

    <label for="dilemma"><b>1. State Your Dilemma or Question:</b></label>
    <textarea id="dilemma" placeholder="e.g., Should I take the new job offer that requires moving?"></textarea>
</div>

<div>
    <label for="analysis"><b>2. Analyze Against Your Constitution:</b> How does this situation stack up against your Core Virtues? Does it risk crossing any of your Bright Lines? Does it move you closer to or further from your Definition of "Winning"?</label>
    <textarea id="analysis" placeholder="e.g., The job aligns with my virtue of 'Intellectual Growth', but moving conflicts with my goal of 'Geographic Freedom'. It does not cross a bright line, but it creates a trade-off..."></textarea>

<div>
    <label for="decision"><b>3. The Path Forward:</b> Based on your analysis, what is the most sovereign course of action?</label>
    <textarea id="decision" placeholder="e.g., I will negotiate for a remote work option. If that fails, I will decline the offer, as maintaining my freedom is a higher priority than the short-term gain of this specific job."></textarea>
