## Initial Thoughts & Goals

**Objective:** To think through a strategic advertising plan for the "Realms of India" project. The goal is to attract a dedicated audience for the books, services, and products.

**Core Idea:** The advertising should not just be about selling, but about building a community of followers who resonate with the "3 paths and 4 realms" concept. It's about attracting "our people."

## Questions to Explore

1.  **Who is the ideal audience member?** What are their hopes, fears, and desires? Where do they hang out online?
2.  **What is the core message?** How can we communicate the value of this framework in a way that is compelling and easy to understand?
3.  **What kind of content will attract them?** Should we focus on educational content, inspirational content, or a mix of both?
4.  **What is the smallest, cheapest experiment we can run to test our assumptions?** Can we start with a small ad spend on Facebook or Instagram to see what resonates?

## Next Steps

*   Flesh out the target audience persona in the `advertising_plan.md`.
*   Brainstorm some initial ad copy and visuals.
*   Set up a simple landing page to capture email addresses.
