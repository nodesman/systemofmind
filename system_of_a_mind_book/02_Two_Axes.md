# Chapter 2: The Two Axes of a Worldview

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of the framework: the Epistemological Axis (Inherited vs. Derived) and the Ethical Axis (Pro-Social vs. Anti-Social). It explains how these two independent axes can be used to map any belief system, from an individual's personal philosophy to the dominant ideology of a nation-state.

*   **The Epistemological Axis (Inherited vs. Derived):** This axis describes how we acquire our knowledge and beliefs.
    *   **Inherited:** We accept our beliefs from an external source, such as our culture, our family, or our religion.
    *   **Derived:** We construct our beliefs from our own, direct experience and critical analysis of the world.

*   **The Ethical Axis (Pro-Social vs. Anti-Social):** This axis describes the fundamental orientation of our values.
    *   **Pro-Social:** We prioritize the well-being of others and the good of the group.
    *   **Anti-Social:** We prioritize our own, personal self-interest, even at the expense of others.

By plotting a belief system on these two axes, we can gain a deeper understanding of its underlying logic and its likely consequences.
