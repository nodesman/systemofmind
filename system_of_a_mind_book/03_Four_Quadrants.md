# Chapter 3: The Four Quadrants of the Mind

This chapter delves into the four primary "mental operating systems" that emerge from the intersection of the two axes, connecting them back to the "Three Paths" metaphor:

*   **Inherited-Static: The Way of the Follower (Path 1):** This quadrant is characterized by a Pro-Social, Inherited worldview. The Follower is a loyal and dedicated member of their group, but they are also resistant to change and new ideas.

*   **Inherited-Dynamic: The Way of the Reformer (Path 2):** This quadrant is also characterized by a Pro-Social, Inherited worldview, but with a crucial difference: the Reformer is open to change and adaptation. They seek to improve their inherited belief system from within, rather than rejecting it entirely.

*   **Derived-Static: The Way of the Ideologue:** This quadrant is characterized by an Anti-Social, Derived worldview. The Ideologue has constructed their own, personal belief system, but they have become so attached to it that they are no longer open to new information or alternative perspectives.

*   **Derived-Dynamic: The Way of the Sovereign Architect (Path 3):** This quadrant is characterized by a Pro-Social, Derived worldview. The Sovereign Architect is a free and independent thinker who is also deeply committed to the well-being of others. They are constantly learning, growing, and adapting their beliefs in response to new evidence and a deeper understanding of the world.
