# Definitions of Done: When is the Book Finished?

The answer to "When is the book done?" is not a single moment, but a series of milestones. A book is "done" many times. This document outlines the different stages of completion, from the initial creative process to the final published product.

### 1. When the First Draft is Complete (The "It Exists" Stage)

This is the first and most celebrated "done." It's the point where you have a complete manuscript from beginning to end. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it has to be whole.

*   **Criteria:**
    *   Every chapter you planned has been written.
    *   The core argument or narrative arc is complete, even if it's rough.
    *   You have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
    *   The word count is in the target ballpark.

At this point, you can confidently say, **"I've written a book."**

### 2. When the Revisions are Complete (The "It's Coherent" Stage)

This is where the real work of writing often happens. You take the raw material of the first draft and shape it into something clear, compelling, and well-structured.

*   **Criteria:**
    *   Major structural issues are resolved (e.g., chapters are in the right order, sections are moved for better flow).
    *   The central argument or story is clear, consistent, and well-supported throughout the manuscript.
    *   The pacing feels right; it doesn't drag in some places or rush in others.
    *   You've "killed your darlings"â€”removed sections, characters, or arguments that you loved but didn't serve the book's core purpose.

At this point, you can say, **"I have a solid manuscript."**

### 3. When the Editing is Complete (The "It's Polished" Stage)

This stage is about refining the language and correcting errors to ensure a professional-quality reading experience. It is often broken into distinct phases:

*   **Line Editing:** Improving sentence flow, word choice, and the overall style to make the prose elegant and effective.
*   **Copyediting:** Fixing technical errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and syntax.
*   **Proofreading:** A final pass to catch any lingering typos or formatting mistakes before publication.

After these steps, you can say, **"The book is professionally written and ready for layout."**

### 4. When It's Ready for an Audience (The "It's Ready" Stage)

This is the point of no return before the book goes public. The author has done all they can, and the manuscript is considered final from a content perspective.

*   **Criteria:**
    *   You, the author, feel the work faithfully represents your vision and intent.
    *   Feedback from trusted beta readers, critique partners, or editors has been considered and incorporated where appropriate.
    *   The manuscript is in a clean, final state, ready for formatting and cover design.

At this point, you can say, **"The book is finished."**

### 5. When It's Published (The "It's Shipped" Stage)

This is the most definitive, final version of "done." The book is now a product. It is out of your hands and in the hands of readers.

*   **Criteria:**
    *   It has a final title, cover, and ISBN.
    *   It has been formatted for print and/or digital distribution.
    *   It is available for purchase or download through distribution channels.

At this point, the work is truly complete and has entered the public sphere.
